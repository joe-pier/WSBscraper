2021-02-02 11:07:09.327854,ShyDudeAskingYou,For those of you who are insecure about whats happening with the price,"The stock's price is being manipulated by bots of the huge hedge funds - what they basically do is resell stocks to each other - this tricks the whole algorithm and it makes the price go down - in reality we are not selling, its the manipulation that does this  


Here: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-trades](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-trades) you can see in real time GME stocks being traded - literally there are 100 shares bought all over the place, at the same second - literally  


I made this post for those of you who are not able to understand the whole situation - so I made the post as simple as possible just to make you feel safe

2021-02-02 11:07:09.814808,notCUSTOMMADE,How to get gud holding 💎🚀🌑," 

Hey guys, first of all, mods please don't remove this.  
Let's get to it.  
I was here for long, without account lurking and just watching what others 🦧did with their money.  
I saw huge losses, I saw wins, but mainly losses.  
This post is not about advice on how to invest or something, but rather to just give you health advice.  
Let's start:

1. Don't go to your stocks app opening it and closing, hoping something happens. The best way to deal with this is to go out and do stuff to keep your mind off. Why should you do this? Is very unhealthy for the brain to continuously check for new stuff.
2. This is also a great tip. While investing is fun and all, you should also look for factors that will show you that you are slowly going into a depression. Look them up, they are easy to spot, and spotting early can help you.
3. Take time off social media, and walk or exercise if you can. While sitting on your pc and phone is also fun, your body needs to work out so it can work properly. You can make a minigame and if $GME stock goes up by 5% you do 5 pushups etc.

These are some tips I have for you folks. If you need more tips just google them. But don't forget TO HOLD AND WHILE HOLDING TO WORK OUT.  
This community brought a smile to my face. That's why I want to help others.

Before I head to bed I feel the need to leave behind three important pieces of information behind for tomorrow. The first one is this:

https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME/interactive-chart

This link provides the information about todays volume. The volume represents the trades that are happening. And today the volume has been really low. This means people are not selling. We have been holding, which should drive the price up.

The second one is this:

https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml

This link provides the information about todays supply/demand considering buy and sell orders (on fidelity). The demand is WAY too high for the supply to meet, which should also drive the price up.

The third is this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la8ox3/at_these_levels_its_not_about_the_price_of_the/

Hedge funds are ""fraudulently creating more shares"" and retail are holding. They are using very ugly tactics in order to bring the price down to a number that satisfies them since even $225 is beyond the amount they are prepared to absolutely-have-to-fucking-pay.


Please stay educated. Do not trade emotionally. And lastly get some rest. We do not know when this shitshow will end. But hopefully we will have left a stain of hope in history behind us.


Please feel free to repost this to infinity. It may satisfy alot of people (like myself) who feel extremely anxious after today, and need a pat on the shoulder.",lasayo,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0D578628>
