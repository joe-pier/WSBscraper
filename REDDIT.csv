For the rest of you *Titanium Scrotum Retards* know that I am proud of each and everyone of you.

What we are doing is monumental. What we are doing is history in the making ! ! !

They are playing every dirty underhanded trick in the book. **We still stand tall and proud ! ! !**

While some of us took a hit today never forget they are losing billions.

If you bought in at a higher price realize these are bargain basement shares for our 💎🙌's taking.

**DON’T Fük-iN SELL!!!!!** **$GME$. . . .** REMEMBER APE TOGETHER STRONG 🦍 🦧

Hold tight my **$GME** Brothers, the gates are in our sites and they will open. . . and when they do ***it will be glorious!!***

1,2021-02-02 12:05:51.054001,baha12022001,LET'S GET #DELIVERTHESHARES AND #STOPCOUNTERFEITINGSHARES TRENDING ON TWITTER,"As the media seems to simply pick up trends on Twitter (initiated by the hedgefund bots) without fact-checking and link them to WSB, I suggest to get these two hashtags trending. 

Yesterday, the SEC released the **""fails-to-deliver""** data for the **first half of January** and it it's thoroughly shocking to see that about **1,7 million shares** have been accumulated in this list within only 15 days. The next data release for the second half might be nuclear 🦍🚀.
This is indicates extremely criminal issuing of counterfeit shares and should be investigated by every credible news outlet (please pick this up WaPo/NYT) and certainly by federal prosecutors. Not to mention the short-ladder attacks that manipulate the price to scare us into selling.

I call on everyone to follow this plea and get these two hashtags trending! Btw if we HOLD 🤲🏾💎🤲🏾💎 they might literally get crushed scrambling for every single share that they can get to cover.

Further TIPS before the market opens: 
1. I recommend you to NOT buy on margin so that they cannot get our shares 
2. Buy NEW shares on Fidelity, Vanguard, TD... hold your GME shares on RH
3. REMOVE $1,000 AND $420,69 LIMITS
4. EXPECT EVERYTHING 
5. DON'T BELIEVE THE FAKE NEWS
