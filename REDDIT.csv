You can play the game here [https://mathspp.com/games/diamond-hands](https://mathspp.com/games/diamond-hands).

I need your help to make the game better.
Can you please comment ideas for the sentences that the game shows? I need more cool sentences for when the price goes up, down, or for when you gain shares for clicking the diamond!

Edit 1: don't buy me awards! Spend your money on something else!

Also, I don't give financial advice and you shouldn't base your investing strategy on the outcome of my game.",lat7px,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0D1D6CB8>
4,2021-02-02 12:13:22.135297,MrDeath2000,Why are no one talking about Turtle Beach Corp (HEAR),"Low PS- and PE- ratio and no debt. They have better numbers than competitors like CRSR and Logitech. HEAR would need to almost double their share price in order to get the same key figures. 

&#x200B;

They have acquired 2 companies since 2019 which shows they are looking to grow. There's also the play on console cycle as Q4 earnings are coming and with the year they've had I can only imagine the numbers will be good.

&#x200B;

Insider selling also very low and the recent sales were from options which might be expiring.

&#x200B;

There are so many good things about this company and it seems really cheap in a market where everything is expensive. What are people thoughts on this company? What am I missing? I bought at 27 and I think it could go to at least 45 short term.",lat7hl,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0D1D6DA8>
