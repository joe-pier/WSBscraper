You may feel like you're losing and everything has been for naught, you may even be thinking about selling at all time lows (but you realised this is a very stupid thought) or that everything you put in will be wasted and you'll be in debt.

It's okay. 

We knew this wouldn't be easy, we're fighting an uphill battle against people who used all types of underhanded methods for years; did we expect it to be easy? No. Did we expect it to be over within a week? Absolutely not. Did we expect it to be this hard? Probably no as well.

Take a deep breath and just know time is on our side, what's the worst that can happen? They keep up the short ladder attacks and expect us to sell? As long as we hold they can't cover their shorts. That's a fact. 

Just hold.

Hold till march if you have to.

Fill those lungs of yours with fresh air, put your phone down and go spend time with your family or go play some PC or Xbox or PS or whatever the fuck you do in your spare time.

You're not alone, we're all in this together and we will gape Melvin's asshole when this is over. Mark my words.",lau8re,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0D9767A8>

4,1612268130.0,30,TappyDev,still on sale - today will be hard to watch - there will be noise - psych warfare tactics in effect - dont fall prey and today will not be green but tomorrow math begins to work its magic,"dont let your guard down... dont read the shitposts on twtr.... the float is huge and to cover they need shares - dont sell and we will be rewarded.  
how do we know it is true - chillman cant stop talking bout it and he cannot explain the move in silver - he will talk about margin req but that alone doesnt put slv in 🚀status.
friday slv was limited and thats bc if you know the next move ahead of your competition, you may get suckers to bite

anyways...im treating myself to more gme on sale, i hope you are too",lau7z0,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0D976EC8>
