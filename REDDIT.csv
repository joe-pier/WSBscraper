1612278437.0,1,peakfreak18,FDA Approval Imminent for $BLUE,"Hey All,

Following up with a 3rd DD after posting these gems last year: [$OZK](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j52m4n/bank_ozk_the_new_century_financial_of_the_current/) &  [$FIT](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j9zayy/why_fitbit_will_trade_higher_than_735_acquisition/). Both were excellent disasters, so sorry to the degens who followed me down those holes. Nonetheless, I doubled down on my $OZK play because I still thing they're shit. 

Moving on, I believe $BLUE is on the verge of FDA approval for one or both of it's key gene therapy drugs. The company currently has a beta thalassemia drug conditionally approved in the EU (Zynteglo), and has a sickle cell drug that's awaiting approval. Last year was rough for the company as it struggled to get approvals, while it continued to burn through cash on its cancer drug research.

The company will be splitting off the cancer division later this year into a separate company, so it can enable both new companies to focus better on their respective applications. As a result, $BLUE is trading below 50% of where it was a year ago, despite having two fully developed drugs in the pipeline.

On to the DD: $BLUE has just posted a role on its website for a VP of US Sales for Zynteglo and the Stem Cell drug [Career Site Link](https://boards.greenhouse.io/bluebirdbioinc/jobs/2291768). These roles are expensive and hard to fill in Boston, indicating that $BLUE feels like they'll need a US sales team soon.  

The Play: Jan 21 2022 Call, $85 strike. It's currently trading at $3.90 per contract. The option will pay out a 100% gain if $BLUE increases to $90 by December '21. Considering this stock reached a high of $230/share on successful trial news, an FDA approval will send this stock soaring. Obviously there's huge risk here, but $BLUE seems to think things are looking up based on their hiring.

TLDR: $BLUE is a pharma stock trading at a discount considering FDA approval may be imminent; they just posted job openings for a US sales VP.",laxn4p,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0D880340>
