2,2021-02-02 12:17:39.730333,Heathen_Scot,Short Ladders Are Not Real,"This past couple of weeks WSB has been the QAnon of finance. Much of what you are told here is wrong.

You can protect yourself to a degree by learning at least the very basics of how markets work. This post will explain to you how prices work on an exchange, and why ""short ladders"" are not even a coherent concept.

**How markets work**

Exchanges have [order books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_book) in which they track interest in a stock. Orders to buy and orders to sell stay in the order book until someone submits an order that matches their price.

The highest price present on buy orders is called the *bid price*.
The lowest price present on sell orders is called the *ask price*.
The difference between the two is called the *spread*.

When you submit an order to the exchange, it trades at the best price it can get. If you're selling, it will sell to the highest bidder even if you said you were willing to sell for zero.

It is possible for companies to trade off-exchange, but when you are looking at the price of a stock on Google or wherever, the price is based on trades that took place on the exchange. For this reason it is common if you're looking at a feed giving you prices in real time to see the price going up and down between two prices for a number of seconds as people sell at bid price and buy at ask price.

**Why short ladders are not possible**

Short ladders are described as two hedge funds selling back and forth to one another at an increasingly lower price.

This makes no sense for the following reasons.

* Off-exchange transactions do not result in ticks. Nobody sees them.
* You cannot target another participant on the exchange to sell to. You have to go through the order book.
* If the order book has $10000 of bids at $100, you cannot drive the price down to $99 except by selling $10000 of stock at $100.

This is a theory made up by someone who has no knowledge of how markets work - if they understood the basics they would at least try to make it believable.

If you google ""short ladder attack"" you will get a bunch of hits on Reddit, [a StackExchange question](https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/135807/closing-shorted-positions-via-short-ladder-attacks) debunking it, and pretty much nothing else of note. If you google ""short attack"" your top two hits are a description from CFO.com of companies releasing a report at the same time they short e.g. alleging financial irregularities, and a piece of frothing madness from SeekingAlpha where some nutter in 2014 makes up a bunch of nonsense involving ""counterfeit shares"".

This is not real.",latax6,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0E188580>

Yesterday, the SEC released the **""fails-to-deliver""** data for the **first half of January** and it it's thoroughly shocking to see that about **1,7 million shares** have been accumulated in this list within only 15 days. The next data release for the second half might be nuclear 🦍🚀.
This is indicates extremely criminal issuing of counterfeit shares and should be investigated by every credible news outlet (please pick this up WaPo/NYT) and certainly by federal prosecutors. Not to mention the short-ladder attacks that manipulate the price to scare us into selling.

I call on everyone to follow this plea and get these two hashtags trending! Btw if we HOLD 🤲🏾💎🤲🏾💎 they might literally get crushed scrambling for every single share that they can get to cover.

Further TIPS before the market opens: 
1. I recommend you to NOT buy on margin so that they cannot get our shares 
2. Buy NEW shares on Fidelity, Vanguard, TD... hold your GME shares on RH
3. REMOVE $1,000 AND $420,69 LIMITS
4. EXPECT EVERYTHING

Consistency is key. Instead of being afraid of losing, be excited about learning.

If you feed your fear, you'll continue living in fear in the future too.

A life you could've lived in the future would probably be lost in the shadows of fear every time you have to make a decision in your life.

Why? Because every time a situation didn't fit your narrative, you pulled out.

TL;DR:


- Short interest seemingly falling despite no shares left to borrow (also caused by ticker dropping over 10% in a day which makes it unshortable), probably because it's masked by millions of new synthetic longs created on 28/01


- Synthetic longs likely defensively created by Market Makers who don't pay interest on them for 21 days, to buy time to protect themselves in the event HFs and brokers aren't enough to cover the squeeze;


- Simultaneously, DTCC recognized financial liability in this squeeze could eventually reach clearing houses if the market makers went bankrupt and on the same date increased collateral requirements to purchase GME to 100%;


- MMs can keep this going for a really long time if needed, but that does not mean forever.

23,2021-02-02 12:17:48.030741,MIA4real,"For those stuck on Robinhood, downgrade to a cash account to prevent your shares from being lent out to short sellers","Fellow autists,

If you are stuck on RH until this saga is over (F), RH **by default** lends out your shares to short sellers (and also pockets the interest payments).

There’s been a rumor that placing high limit sells prevents your shares from being lent out to short sellers, this has been debunked and is thoroughly false.

The **only** way to prevent your shares from being lent out is to downgrade your account into a [Cash Account](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/robinhood-accounts/). RH makes this a pain in the ass to do so, so I’ve written a step-by-step guide:

1. Go to your account tab (person icon on the bottom right)
2. Go to “Investing”
3. Scroll down to “Something Else”
4. Scroll down **again** to “Something Else”
5. Type in: Please downgrade my Robinhood account into a “Robinhood Cash” account immediately 

Someone from RH support will then convert your account into a cash account and prevent your shares from being lent out.

Note: this does turn off instant settlement, for example if you sell a stock - the money won’t appear in your account until 1-2 days later. This also turns off instant deposit, who cares though as RH prevents you from buying so many stocks at this point.

*obligatory disclaimer for the SEC intern: this isn’t financial advice, people can do this if they want to*

💎🤚🚀🚀🚀

Edit: The default RH account type is “Robinhood Instant”. You can also upgrade to a “Robinhood Gold”. **Both** of these account types let RH lend your shares out

In actual fact this DOES NOT reduce short % as its a matter of shifting shares around. There is no large dump from long holders.

3 key advice:
A. Do not panic sell - you know about the squeeze and that takes time. By now you should have enough or excess cash to back your holdings since brokers increased margins to 100% on meme stocks

B. Remove your stop losses now and don’t wait till market open. Your PC or phone app will definitely crash and good chance it will be force sold. Refer to A about your cash reserve 

C. Set buy limits as bots push it down, im DCA my shares from 264 and set buy limits in blocks of 5 for $190, 180, 170 and 160.

Finally since you are in for the LONG game, put the phone away and go for a walk or jerk off or sniff people farts  💨 to not grow fear, thats what the shorts want you to feel.

28,2021-02-02 12:17:49.695508,The_Prince_of_LA,How to Win GME,"This week, we have experienced blatant market manipulation from the other side. They have spread misdirection via fake stories from corrupt reporters. They have used computer algorithms that buy and sell from each other to drive the price down. Monday's exact -100 result was a giant FU to us, telling us they control the price.

However, we have the power of numbers and we have the power of public sentiment. We are fighting an honorable battle against an EVIL foe. We are on the side of good, and there is a very simple strategy that we can use to win.

**Go to a cash account**. If EVERYONE with a brokerage account, even people who don't own GME stock, contacted their broker and turned their account into a CASH account, that will stop our brokers from lending our shares to hedge funds to use to short stocks. If EVERYONE did this, all lent out shares would be called back and hedge funds would have to close their short positions by BUYING shares. They will have to buy shares all across the market and those stocks will go up in price. They will have to sell some long shares in order to come up with capital to close their shorts, but overall the market should be neutral.

We don't control fake news. We don't manipulate stocks. We just like stocks and like talking about them. Our strength is in our solidarity and we have the support of the people. If we can make this into a movement and ask people to stop using margin and turn their accounts into CASH accounts in solidarity with us, we will win. Also, it will PISS them off because they can't cheat their way around it.

CASH ACCOUNT FTW.

**Technicals**

It has broken the downtrend and is continuously making new higher highs. Next major resistance levels I see are only around 20$, 22$ and 23$

**Fundamentals**

From fundamentals perspective I think they are doing much better than where their stock price stands. I feel they are undervalued due to some crazy events last year after they merged with their competitor and their own CEO left the organisation. 

Since the change of the CEO there has been some uptick movement and probably it can pick up some pace soon. I think this can be another hidden gem.

Sorry idk much about the details but let’s say they shorted 140% @ $7 or $20 whatever it was.. price goes to 400, they short again another 140% and give back all the stock they owed in the previous short. Is there a law against this? I’m not a professional I was just wondering how they could possibly maneuver out of this with how they’ve manipulated the market these past several days. So they short again at 300,400,200 whatever the price, then buy it back or whatever slowly throughout the coming weeks to pay back the higher cost short. 

Just a thought and I know I’ll prob get roasted but it’s cool I would do that if I fucked up if I could lol seems like a logical thing to do considering they can manipulate the market when it’s so volatile",laslas,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0E0689E8>

50,2021-02-02 12:17:56.535615,Mitesite,The dip before the Volkswagen short squeeze is misleading,"I keep seeing people reference the dip that Volkswagen took before it squeezed, but I think that it's completely misleading. Volkswagen went from a high of €421.18 on 10/16/2008 to a low of €198.72 on 10/24/2008, a drop of 52.8%, but this had nothing to do with the short squeeze. This was part of a broad market pullback in which the DAX 30 (German equivalent of the DOW) fell over 25% between 10/14 and 10/24, and several of the largest German companies such as SAP also fell over 50% like Volkswagen.

The short squeeze wasn't initiated until Sunday, 10/26, when Porsche unexpectedly announced that it effectively raised its stake in Volkswagen to 74% through call options. This is what triggered panic among short sellers due to the fact that this would reduce Volkswagen's public float to just 1%, while 12.8% of the stock was shorted. As a result, the stock rocketed from its Friday closing price of €208.16 to a high of €978.92 on Tuesday, 10/28, a rise of 370% in 2 days. It quickly fell to a closing price of €508.84 the next day, and continued falling in the months following.

So, what I'm saying is the VW dip that has been spread everywhere across this sub had nothing to do with the subsequent short squeeze. Please let me know if I'm missing something here.",lasg2i,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0E098F88>

Hey guys, first of all, mods please don't remove this.  
Let's get to it.  
I was here for long, without account lurking and just watching what others 🦧did with their money.  
I saw huge losses, I saw wins, but mainly losses.  
This post is not about advice on how to invest or something, but rather to just give you health advice.  
Let's start:

1. Don't go to your stocks app opening it and closing, hoping something happens. The best way to deal with this is to go out and do stuff to keep your mind off. Why should you do this? Is very unhealthy for the brain to continuously check for new stuff.
2. This is also a great tip. While investing is fun and all, you should also look for factors that will show you that you are slowly going into a depression. Look them up, they are easy to spot, and spotting early can help you.
3. Take time off social media, and walk or exercise if you can. While sitting on your pc and phone is also fun, your body needs to work out so it can work properly. You can make a minigame and if $GME stock goes up by 5% you do 5 pushups etc.

These are some tips I have for you folks. If you need more tips just google them. But don't forget TO HOLD AND WHILE HOLDING TO WORK OUT.  
This community brought a smile to my face. That's why I want to help others.

Before I head to bed I feel the need to leave behind three important pieces of information behind for tomorrow. The first one is this:

https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME/interactive-chart

This link provides the information about todays volume. The volume represents the trades that are happening. And today the volume has been really low. This means people are not selling. We have been holding, which should drive the price up.

The second one is this:

https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml

This link provides the information about todays supply/demand considering buy and sell orders (on fidelity). The demand is WAY too high for the supply to meet, which should also drive the price up.

The third is this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la8ox3/at_these_levels_its_not_about_the_price_of_the/

Hedge funds are ""fraudulently creating more shares"" and retail are holding. They are using very ugly tactics in order to bring the price down to a number that satisfies them since even $225 is beyond the amount they are prepared to absolutely-have-to-fucking-pay.


Please stay educated. Do not trade emotionally. And lastly get some rest. We do not know when this shitshow will end. But hopefully we will have left a stain of hope in history behind us.

62,2021-02-02 12:18:01.313619,kingme805,Theme Park,"-SHITPOST-

TLDR: liftoff is a waiting process. Hold on to your hair, and your bladder..

Late 2000s. Knotts Berry Farm. It has all the typical rides that any theme park would have. The half-pipe, the weird and fun twisty ones, and the water ride that would wet your gonads like a $20 hooker about to pass out from sucking a bunch of pp all day. “Hmm, tongue swipes..” you think to yourself. “Cool.”

You’ve just gotten off this ride and you’re about to hop on the next one, the Accelerator. Now this fucking thing. This fucking ride is something. You’ve been looking forward to this one all day. Simply put, it has the mechanics of a Tesla before Tesla’s we’re even cool. 0-60 in under 4 seconds? You think, “Shit, sign me up.” Meanwhile, your crotch is drying off from those pitiful wank-licks you just received. You’ll end up hopping on this one with dry pants and a new vigor. Among one of its characteristics is the massive vertical loop. You see people entering the ride and subsequently hold on for dear life to any part of the visibly worn metal guards as they rocket past the loading zone and scream with delight. Shouldn’t have done your hair today. It gives off the appearance of wet, freshly cut grass plumps after a ride. “Oh well..” you think to yourself.

While you’re waiting in the line for the ride, you come to notice the heat. It’s a standing heat and it really bothers you all of a sudden. Because of that, you begin to notice the smell. Oh god, some kid just farted in front of you. What you would do to give that little shit a lecture, but you can’t. His parents are right there with him. Okay, besides the heat and essence of booty particles, what els- “waiting!” Why the fuck do you and a bunch of other people commit to waiting in this godforsaken line together? Being a retard, you know you should’ve bought the express pass for an extra $20. 

“Well fuck.” You have another 10 minutes before it’s your turn on the ride. “Might as well check my phone.” -a Motorola Razr. You pull it out and flex that shit in front of the crowds around you, but you realize everyone around you has one. Feelings of insecurity arise. “Damn. This phone ain’t that special..” you think to yourself as you’ve slowly inched up to the next in line on the Accelerator. 

You feel a woosh of air as the rollercoaster blasts off out of the sight of everyone as they’ve entered a vertical climb to the heavens. After about a minute, the carts come back to their stationary position right in front of you. “Probably shouldn’t have put that product in my hair. Shit’s all messed up by now.” By now, you’ve totally forgotten about that sorry, fart-particle homunculus as you line up. Your crotch is nice and dry now as you adjust your pants to fit comfortably in your seat. 

Your palms have begun to sweat a little bit as you make your way inside the cart. Your heart starts beating a little bit faster. When the ride operator checks with you, he asks if you’re doing all right. You choke up for a second as you make eye contact and just give him a passive thumbs up. He walks away. Eyes now back in front. They expand as you subconsciously know what’s coming. Your hearing dials in and begins to muffle out what anyone else is saying. You’re having second thoughts about this ride. Too late. You’re strapped in. Time begins to slow. You attempt to take a deep breath. Nope. You instantly feel your back get jammed into your seat as you accelerate. “Tongue swipes now?” you think as you feel a sense of warmth in that fleeting moment.

65,2021-02-02 12:18:02.246469,shortgamegolfer,Dear Kingtard,"Dear Facebook,
You know what you could really use? A retail store. A safe place where people can go to transact Marketplace business in person, or get a t-shirt made of their favorite photo of the dog humping their leg. A place that maybe used to sell amusements to local neckbeards, but fell on hard times. Then maybe you saw an opportunity to buy up all the shares of it, and maybe somehow you got a monstrous donation from a hedge fund to make it all essentially free. Not sure how that would happen, and I know this idea may sound retarded, but you are already lead by the reigning king of all autists, with his Nero haircut and emotionless, porcelain face, just like a big doll my aunt will come and sell to some other aunt at your new retail store. While there, they’ll show each other baby photos on an experience wall and become lifelong friends. “Oh here’s a nice photo of my loser, video game addicted nephew taking a bong rip. Oh you have one too? Let’s sit down in the coffee corner and talk more.” You guys recently mentioned seeing Apple as your biggest competitor. Maybe find someone who already has stores in the same area. 

I’m not telling you how to run your business, but you need to add this kind of service, and maybe if would be easier to buy out an existing retailer than to build from scratch. I have no suggestion on who it would be... can’t think of anyone right now. Also, please don’t take this as financial advice, for it is not.

74,2021-02-02 12:18:05.217052,BuddyGuyBruh,Going against the grain and looking at possible exits for GME in the worst case,"This is probably going to get downvoted to oblivion but after being very bullish last Thursday I have **changed** my opinion over the weekend and yesterday.

&#x200B;

It seems a lot of people here are emotional and are just in it to stick to wallstreet. 

Personally, I am not part of wallstreetbets to stick it to anyone or to make myself be a martyr for any cause. I am in it to make money. While I personally support a lot of views here and the blatant bs that is happening in form of **market manipulation**, brokers like RH having issues with their **clearing houses** (or so they claim) and **restricting trading**, **media**, and a bunch of other infuriating factors makes me pissed too. 

However, hijacking the sub just for GME and not burying all other DD is just dumb. 

&#x200B;

**But the moment you start investing with your emotions you lose.**

At the moment I feel extremely blind since I do not know what is real and what is manufactured info and we do not know the real short interest. **That plus all these emotions from people here is** making me uneasy.

&#x200B;

# I am trying to look for a potential exit.

Based on the short interest reported being so low, it seems a lot of shorts have covered their positions (this could be manipulated data but we have to go on what we have). It seems they did most of their covering AH and during retail sell-offs that they artificially created by manipulating the price in AH.

&#x200B;

# Retail vs Institution change in the charts:

It does seem that most of retail has gotten in on Monday and Tuesday and that after that it was institutions playing their games. You can see this by how radically different the graphs look for days after Tuesday of last week.

&#x200B;

[Volume and the movement of price is completely different after Wednesday  which makes me think it is institutions and other hedge funds that got it to trade volatility, notice the massive price gaps AH ](https://preview.redd.it/evdnw7xd71f61.png?width=1545&format=png&auto=webp&s=5594df708bbf563cc18f4e1ddf06d53139fdb54d)

&#x200B;

This with the addition of restriction of retail buyers is making me bearish because I believe that the shorts managed to get out during this time and the new shorts got in while the older ones blew up earlier and have covered during AH.

&#x200B;

# Supports to avoid shakeouts:

It seems that the last support level around $160 range if broken is what would trigger me to sell. There was one wick that went as low as $110 on the 28th, this is a problem because during the free fall of the breakers it broke through the $160 support like nothing yet recovered. Setting a stop loss at $160 could cause your position to just be shaken out. But setting your stop loss at $110 or below is too low imo but could be a reasonable stop loss to prevent getting shaken out of your position if you believe the short squeeze is still coming.

&#x200B;

[Trying to avoid getting shaken out at $110, this was probably their test to see how low they can flash crash the price to pick up as many shares if they were to cover their shorts.](https://preview.redd.it/bxtxqa4n71f61.png?width=1543&format=png&auto=webp&s=567bd77db52fe4b7a2bc4b5664664f36944d1e7f)

# Comparison with VW in 2008

The balancing act here is finding the sweet spot where you will not get shaken out in case the data is manipulated and the squeeze rockets to $1000+/share but also not to be low enough that your losses are massive.

&#x200B;

[You want to avoid selling here and not get shaken out \( I believe that would be $110 for GME\)](https://preview.redd.it/my0icm4s71f61.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=5772850ff659033abbc5e03a3c2bff38976c5e54)

&#x200B;

If you are more conservative I would take the profits around 160, if you want to potentially wait for squeeze and not get shaken out $110 seems like a reasonable stop loss.

Depending on the pre-market sentiment by morning I will be looking to either get out at 160 or holding.

&#x200B;

I am not trying to scare anyone just trying to do my own exit strategy, Do your own research. I do not have a crystal ball. After the official short interest is released I may look to reenter the position in GME if I get out, but profit is profit till then.

86,2021-02-02 12:18:09.552351,kingkierite,GME holders - Why you should know what confirmation bias is.,"We are all human. When making trades it is very important to be aware of your emotions. You don't need to become emotionless but moreso conscious of how you react and behave.

Confirmation bias is the tendency to only take on information/opinions that agree with what you believe is (or will be) the case. This emotional bias is highly elevated when the issue is self relevant i.e. if you hold GME and think it will go to the moon, you will read more posts that agree with what you want to be true and toss others to the side, maybe even put them down.

This is bad.

Contrary to popular belief, you can't just manifest a trade or price increase. For example, price goes up and you think it's a good time to sell. You check Reddit and some ape says ""GME will hit 1000 EOD 🚀🚀🚀"" and this makes you hold on a little longer. Pure greed. Other people being allowed to change your opinion on a good trade is poor on your behalf. 

Read what you want to read, trade how you want to trade. Just be aware of how you react and behave with skin in the game.

TL;DR 
If you want GME to go to the moon, you're more than likely only reading comments that say ""GME to the moon"" and everyone else's opinion doesn't matter.

88,2021-02-02 12:18:10.630046,CompleteBrat,A brief history of Melvin Capitals & Point72s founding,"**BE CAREFUL - LOTS OF WORDS**

I love the different forms of DD we had in the past couple of weeks. Most of them were very technical and I personally found a more and more increasing interest in the people we love to hate. 

I spend the past couple of hours trying to understand what happened in a time where most of us were busy getting to the new level cap of Lich King whilst boomers managed to fuck up the economy. Yes. I’m talking about 2008.

You see, Melvin Capitals story begins under the wings of Steve Cohens S.A.C. Capital. US Attorney Preet Bharara described them as following in 2013: 

*  “culture of corporate corruption”
*  “institutional indifference to unlawful conduct \[that\] resulted in insider trading that was substantial, pervasive, and on a scale without known precedent in the hedge-fund industry.”
*  “a veritable magnet of market cheaters”

If that isn't off to a great start, right? To understand the story I'm about to tell you, here a short summary of how SAC was structured: 

„SAC was structured like a bicycle wheel, with the spokes consisting of about 100 portfolio managers with their own teams of analysts and traders working in competition with the other teams. Camaraderie in SAC’s offices was low. At the center was Cohen, 57, the only connector between the different groups, who would take the best ideas from each and trade on them himself. Aside from losing money, there was nothing Cohen hated more than a portfolio manager who didn’t communicate vigorously and often.“

In 2008 two employees were charged with insider trading. One of them was Mather Martoma who was involved in insider trading with a new Alzheimer drug that first showed positive and then negative results which helped Cohen get out at a perfect time and thus avoided a $275million loss. 

The other was Jon Horvath, he claimed that his asshole boss Steinberg told him get insider information to get better trades or else he would be fired. So he did with DELL and also passed this information to Steinberg. With this insider information he found out DELL was going to have a bad quarter and built up a massive short position only to find out that his even BIGGER ASSHOLE BOSS COHEN was long DELL. And FUCK was he scared of Cohen, the ragey ass went on a rampage whenever he lost money so he mailed Steinberg to tell him about his concerns. Now it get’s interesting. Steinberg told Cohen and Cohen told Steinberg to figure out who the fuck was right. Jon or the person suggesting him this trade – Gabriel fucking Plotkin. You may be asking “Who dis?“ -it's **Melvin Capitals later fucking founder**. After some back and forth Plotkin realized Jon had the better source and confirmed to sell the long position. After its earnings announement DELL dropped 14%. Good job Jon. 

Later that evening, Cohen sent Steinberg a message that read: “Nice job on dell.” Steinberg’s response was, “Thanks… this ole dog can still hunt”.

This happened again. This time Steinberg/Jon being long, Cohen short. Here a chat: 

>AIM:mike72ms \[Steinberg\] dell rpts thrusday  
AIM:cas— \[Cohen\] y …   
AIM:mike72ms **we like it**…weve been good here if u remember  
AIM:cas— call me… it’s a shame-cause I can be helpful to you too but that;s life  
AIM:mike72ms steve I have an analyst that covers this stock… he has industry contacts… im not hiding anything from u

Cohen replied: “I would prefer to talkon phone”.

I decided to leave in the chat because both sound like fucking retards and Cohen like a salty 9 year old. Truely, no different to us

Martoma, the guy with the Alzheimer drug was convicted to a 9 year prison sentence. 

Jon decided to work with prosecutors to try help fuck over Steinberg but in 2015 the case was abandoned. 

In 2011 Plotkin was apparently investigated for trading Weight Watchers based on insider information. An SAC spokesperson denied this claim however by saying „Gabe Plotkin has built a successful career on a commitment to sound fundamental research“

In 2013 SAC pleaded guilty to an insider trading charge, paid an $1.8 billion penalty and changed its name to Point72 Asset Management. Cohen shrunk the companies size and said goodbye to many of his portfolio managers. 

In 2013 the SEC also charged Steve Cohen with a „failing to supervise“ civil charge in regards to Martoma with the goal to give Cohen a lifetime ban from supervising funds that manage outside money. In the end they settled for a two year ban which I guess is almost the same thing. It is rumoured that Plotkin is the mysterious „Portfolio Manager A“ in this charge

In 2014-2015 Cohen took steps to „increase compliance and oversight” at Point72. He hired former F.B.I agents and federal prosecutors. For example Kevin J. O’Connor and Vincent Tortorella. Some saw this as an effort to “gain the confidence of regulators and permit him to again manage money for outside investors.“

In 2014 Gabriel Plotkin, „one of Cohens most successful traders” founded Melvin Capital. Cohen backed him with a small loan of 200 milion dollars.

In a memo sent to more than 800 employees of Point72, Mr. Cohen said that after SAC pleaded guilty, he “vowed that what happened to SAC would never happen to Point72.” The settlement “is not and cannot — be a reason to become complacent,” Mr. Cohen wrote, adding that the firm would become a leader in compliance.

Fact is, the SEC spent almost a decade trying to get dirt on Steve Cohen and failed. Plotkin got a slap on the wrist by being hinted at in the civil charge against Cohen and Steinbergs case was dropped. But hey, the **analyst** who forwarded insider information in 2008 about an alzheimer drug will be freed from prison soon after 9 years in jail. I know insider trading is irrelevant to the current situation however I found the story interesting because it shows by what rules they play and what type of people they are. 

TL;DR: The people behind Melvin and friends are frauds and cheaters. They never played by the rules, never will. SEC knows this but literally can't do anything.

92,2021-02-02 12:18:12.969424,Geko2012,Connecting the dots GME ladder attack monkey brain style.," 

Today (2/1) didn't go as many expected.

Some expected things to get uglier for obvious reasons. Last week was bad but at the end of it it seemed as an overwhelming success for everyone who is rooting for GME.

Tendies were expected today... didnt happen.

So what did happened? My monkey brain was trying to comprehend the events and occurrences.

One thing that was noted by fellow monkey brain was how chunks of 100 shares have been traded back and forth in rapid succession.  
People soon attributed this to the short sellers running a ladder attack to drive the price down to bring retail investors to sell their shares so shorties can gobble them up and cover.

This tactic had been used last week too so it came to no surprise.

Now apparently news media is reporting that shorts have been covered from a 120 something% down to 39%. How is that even possible when GME ended so strong last week.

Naturally there should follow a huge price spike if that was the case.

My monkey brain keeps thinking back to those chunks of 100 shares traded. I watched it last week and i did today.

Now things seemed to get really heated last Thursday 01/28, some say the squeeze was about to happen that day and that's when the ladder attack hit. Thats when market manipulation was so obvious it was in EVERYONES face. Restricting sales of shares getting the media involved and so on and so forth

In chunks of 100,

One contract of a call or put is for the right but not the obligation to exercise 100 shares.

Ok fine...So... what does that mean.... monkey brain tired no understand big numbers.

Some have noticed that the fail to deliver securities data shows a significant amount of GME stock not being able to cover, however the data is not up to date. We are lagging behind by a little

Going back to the trade restrictions for GME, many platforms have limited the purchase of GME stock

Over the last couple of days i have been reading one broker being mentioned over and over....  
Who is that ? Fidelity it just so happens that fidelity is one of the major stock holders of GME is that coincidence ? There are others but there is no need to go into detail.

After RobbinHood placed the restriction the price action went down but the shorties have been still trading, how? Where are they getting their shares from?

Are there even shares left ? THAT IS THE BIG QUESTION

Its a mess and to make a long story short i believe but do not know for certain that the short ladder attack is actually a form to cover shorties shorts temporarily just like writing checks back and forth to banks.

I am sorry guys i tried my best here... a lot has happened today and the last 7 days.  
To make it clear i am a retard using his limited brain cells which are decaying rapidly every hour to make some sense of this myself. In no form or way should this affect your decision in buying or selling GME stock. I dont know what i am talking about.

99,2021-02-02 12:18:15.868796,ASoftEngStudent,DDDD - Is GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold?,"This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or ""counterfeit"" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.

Much of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.

One thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

**Methodology**

I'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that

1) Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.

2) The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.

3) The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date

However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.

**The Code**

    from collections import defaultdict
    import time
    import requests
    POLYGON_API_KEY = '<ADD YOUR API KEY HERE>'
    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY
    
    # Reads data
    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))
    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm
    for line in f:
        parts = line.split('|');
        date = parts[0]
        ticker = parts[2]
        try:
            fails = int(parts[3])
            price = float(parts[5])
            value_of_fails = price * fails
            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = value_of_fails
        except ValueError:
            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')
            pass
    
    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():
        day = int(date[-2:])
        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))
        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1])
        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1] > 10000000, sorted_stocks)
        for ticker, val_of_fails in sorted_stocks:
            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))
            res = req.json()
            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':
                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))
                continue
            else:
                try:
                    volume = res['volume']
                except KeyError:
                    print(res)
            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)
            pct_vol = val_of_fails / volume
            print('{: <6} ${: <5} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', pct_vol))

Here's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.

If everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value > 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.
