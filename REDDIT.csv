2021-02-02 10:38:33.408947,Astronaut-Frost,Remember Deep Fucking Value did excellent DD.,"DFV found value. Made a bet on it.

A lot of people on here are being insane right now in the most retarded way possible. Anything that is not confirmation bias for the stock you own you downvote it. You are not even listening. 

It becomes really dangerous if you start to believe any negative information is a false flag from rich wall street.

I have learned in this process that a lot of financial rumors are just bullshit. Just pushing the stock price around and fucking with us. Healthy skepticism is key.

But, some negative news is real. Or, should at least be considered.

2021-02-02 10:38:33.638527,BuddyGuyBruh,Going against the grain and looking at possible exits for GME in the worst case,"This is probably going to get downvoted to oblivion but after being very bullish last Thursday I have **changed** my opinion over the weekend and yesterday.

&#x200B;

It seems a lot of people here are emotional and are just in it to stick to wallstreet. 

Personally, I am not part of wallstreetbets to stick it to anyone or to make myself be a martyr for any cause. I am in it to make money. While I personally support a lot of views here and the blatant bs that is happening in form of **market manipulation**, brokers like RH having issues with their **clearing houses** (or so they claim) and **restricting trading**, **media**, and a bunch of other infuriating factors makes me pissed too. 

However, hijacking the sub just for GME and not burying all other DD is just dumb. 

&#x200B;

**But the moment you start investing with your emotions you lose.**

At the moment I feel extremely blind since I do not know what is real and what is manufactured info and we do not know the real short interest. **That plus all these emotions from people here is** making me uneasy.

&#x200B;

# I am trying to look for a potential exit.

Based on the short interest reported being so low, it seems a lot of shorts have covered their positions (this could be manipulated data but we have to go on what we have). It seems they did most of their covering AH and during retail sell-offs that they artificially created by manipulating the price in AH.

&#x200B;

# Retail vs Institution change in the charts:

It does seem that most of retail has gotten in on Monday and Tuesday and that after that it was institutions playing their games. You can see this by how radically different the graphs look for days after Tuesday of last week.

&#x200B;

*Processing img evdnw7xd71f61...*

&#x200B;

This with the addition of restriction of retail buyers is making me bearish because I believe that the shorts managed to get out during this time and the new shorts got in while the older ones blew up earlier and have covered during AH.

&#x200B;

# Supports to avoid shakeouts:

It seems that the last support level around $160 range if broken is what would trigger me to sell. There was one wick that went as low as $110 on the 28th, this is a problem because during the free fall of the breakers it broke through the $160 support like nothing yet recovered. Setting a stop loss at $160 could cause your position to just be shaken out. But setting your stop loss at $110 or below is too low imo but could be a reasonable stop loss to prevent getting shaken out of your position if you believe the short squeeze is still coming.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Comparison with VW in 2008

The balancing act here is finding the sweet spot where you will not get shaken out in case the data is manipulated and the squeeze rockets to $1000+/share but also not to be low enough that your losses are massive.

&#x200B;

[You want to avoid selling here and not get shaken out \( I believe that would be $110 for GME\)](https://preview.redd.it/my0icm4s71f61.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=5772850ff659033abbc5e03a3c2bff38976c5e54)

&#x200B;

If you are more conservative I would take the profits around 160, if you want to potentially wait for squeeze and not get shaken out $110 seems like a reasonable stop loss.

Depending on the pre-market sentiment by morning I will be looking to either get out at 160 or holding.

&#x200B;

I am not trying to scare anyone just trying to do my own exit strategy, Do your own research. I do not have a crystal ball. After the official short interest is released I may look to reenter the position in GME if I get out, but profit is profit till then.

&#x200B;

# TLDR:

* If we are above $160 ------->  💎 👐  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀 
* If we are inbetween $110 - $160 ---->  🌈🐻 
* If we are below $110 ------>  🧻✋",larxmg,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0D673610>

2021-02-02 10:38:34.388924,ThatGuyOnTheReddits,💎 $GME 💎 Options Delivery Tracking Thread. Were Your Shares Delivered Today?...,"I want to start a thread before the market opens, where we can track the options that members executed on Friday.

We need to be tracking how many shares from these options are delivered today, and how many people that EXECUTED (not let them expire) their calls get their shares today. 

It would help keep a somewhat accurate count of the shares taken off the market on Friday with option calls by members here. It would also help us get ahead of the Failure To Deliver numbers.

I'm anticipating some delivery fuckery.

Steel your resolve for the week. We ride to our destiny...

2021-02-02 10:38:35.159280,LostAK,We won't actually know how much GME is still shorted until the 9TH OF FEBRUARY,"Short interest position is reported to FINRA twice per month and DOESN'T NECESSARILY CORRELATE with daily short volume. They are two different metrics that both have *short* in the name and I feel I've seen a few posts that are intentionally conflating the two to try and confuse people.

A decent explanation is here [OTC Markets BLOG](https://blog.otcmarkets.com/2018/11/13/understanding-short-sale-activity/)

FINRA Reporting schedule is [here](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest)

All these people saying that the squeeze has or hasn't happened are talking out their ass unless they're privy to some insider information, which newsflash they probably are fucking not. I'm holding until I know for sure. I'm confident I'll be dabbing billionaire tears with my 💎🙌 held handkerchief but I'm also prepared to make an exit strategy come February 9th if the Short Interest ratio has somehow dropped to nothing.

In other news, if you're wondering what a good common sense askance from ~~your corrupt as fuck federal agency~~ the SEC to keep something like this from happening again, require more regular reporting of short sale positions. BiWeekly is a joke intended to keep the process as opaque as possible.
