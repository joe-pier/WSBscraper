1612303027.0,1,A MESSAGE TO DFV: I think it needs to be said.,"Dude, thank you so much for holding today. It was a straight-up war. I know it's not your job to have the weight of all these people on your back and you must be fucking exhausted but let me say this: In 08 I was in my early 20's and had an amazing job that I put away almost a half mil into retirement over the few years I was at that company. Then overnight,, it was gone. I sat and watched that number dip and dip until nothing. I watched all my plans go away. I was literally heartbroken and scared. I appreciate you.

Today, I  am sitting in the deep minus -15k. I decided to risk my savings- not because I think I'll ""get them back"" but because I believe that we have the opportunity to come together and do something great. In 08 we couldn't do shit, but today we are in control of what is next.

Like it or not man you are the one we look to at 4:00pm praying that you are in this game with us still. Again, not your job, and no one officially appointed you a leader of the idiots, but it is so fucking meaningful that you are still in this with us. When you sell,  regardless of circumstances I will be the first to say thank you, even if I eat my lunch. I made my choice.

But god damn, after today, I needed your post showing your L's. I needed some kind of hope that this crazy fucking idea will play out. I needed the inspiration that buying in again for another $1000 this morning might make sense in a few days or a  week.

I won't get rich off this. I  only hope to change my circumstances just enough so I don't go to sleep every night thinking about the fact that these fucks once took everything from me, and for just once, us little dummies can win.

1612303004.0,3,"DD of a Retard, what happens next","Alright, I gotta say this. I think I've got their plan pegged, but I am retarded so somebody correct me if I'm wrong. This is from the hedge funds theoretical perspective. This is the play I would do in their shoes.

Hedge funds short GME, whoops it's too much and reddit caught on. Gamma squeeze got em up to $500 ish, but now we stopped the gamma feedback loop by throwing every piece of ammo we had at the stock by utilizing Short Ladder techniques. beep boop beep boop the algorithm starts the short ladder.

They implement disinformation campaigns in the form of cnbc, bloomberg, washington street journal, and others to try to get people to bail on GME and invest in other tickers. Didn't work very well, or did it?

They implement bots that flood the networks, ddos'ing everything along the way including reddit and this subreddit. Bots say shit like ""Buy AMC, Buy NOK, NOK NOK NOK, SLV is going to the moon"". Subreddit shuts down briefly to remove the bots, but this strategy was effective. Now you've got FUD and FOMO working against the retailers.

Price tanks to $70, good. This is the magic number. Oh what's that? Call options got super cheap for the $800 3/19? Hmm, better buy a metric fuckload of those. Maybe they won't catch on.

We shorted the market, so we have to cover those shorts. But the price spiraled out of control and now we are not only in debt to a lot of other hedge funds, we are broke. But maybe we can get these call options with the last bit of ammo.

You are here.

What happens next seems pretty logical to me. The short interest hedge funds stop the bots and disinformation (this just happened today) and the ladder attacks. Now, the price goes up and up and up like it was supposed to, if we hadn't done the ladder attacks. Price going up is now in our interest since we did what hedge funds do, and bet long with the call options. If we can get the price above $800 a share, boom massive fucking payday, and we can then use that cash to cover the remaining short interest.

That only goes so far, we can't push the price up much further because, well, we have to sell those shares we got from exercising the call options and that will tank the price into the dumpster again. Now we have a ton of money to continue covering. Back up the price goes, we do call options again along the way, and those calls pay for the subsequent cover.

I think this will need to happen multiple times over and over again before they can fully cover. Outside of a government bailout (which neither the hedgies or the government wants to do), this is the only way I see of them being able to raise the capital and manipulate the market enough to cover. I think this is going to be an up and down rollercoaster around the $850-$900 mark and back down to the low $100's. Once or twice a week max, for 4 weeks.

My plan? Well, diamond hands. I do intend to mimic their movements so that I can increase my share pool, and I may do call options myself. Someone, probably the hedgies, is spending retarded money on these call options. Those are big, big money plays that retards like us can't afford. Unless it's some billionaire trying to lose his fortune, it's gotta be the hedgies. They are in charge of the price of the market due to all their tricks. They wrote the rules. They are now going to use those rules to not only make it out of this cover alive, but probably profit off of it still.

There's no investment advice in here. It's just what my retard brain thinks is happening. I'm not an experienced trader, I've never done a call option and I don't even know how to exercise one. This makes sense to me, this timeline. So let me know if you think it's going to be different, and why. A lot of lives are on the line here, possibly literally. So if hedgies can sit around in a room and talk strat, we should be able to as well."

1612302963.0,12,Can we still win? Why? Realistic timeline?,"I’m seeing a lot of paper hands out there, but I’m ready to go down with the ship. 💎 🙌🏽 

Now, I still find myself asking questions with the hopes of learning what I can from this whole event. 

1. Can we still win? 
I feel like WSB is no longer an accurate place for information. Yes some of it is real and good but you have to sort through so much crap. How many of us apes are imposters posting fake loss porn and fake HOLD posts to convince everyone else into holding the bag? 
Is there any precedent to what we are up against?

2. What do we stand to gain at this point? How long do we have to hang tight?
If the shares are not being bought by us but instead by hedge funds... then won’t they be able to recycle the shares enough times to escape at a reduced cost and there will be no squeeze? I’m a retard so I don’t quite fully get this, but people’s comments make me think this is possible. 

3. How can WSB lift the facts up and not just what we want to hear? The sub is so saturated now as I mentioned above. How can we focus on pushing this event to the finish line? We need to unify. I moved my other meme stock positions to GME to fortify the line. 

4. At the very least we had fun doing it, right? I’ve had fun. Gonna keep battling with you tards. Never play with more than you can afford to lose. 


I hope the squeeze has not yet been squoze.
I hope all of you posting loss porn and buying into the culture are real and not bots.

&#x200B;

 

Fellow Amazonians:

I’m excited to announce that this Q3 I’ll transition to Executive Chair of the Amazon Board and Andy Jassy will become CEO. In the Exec Chair role, I intend to focus my energies and attention on new products and early initiatives. Andy is well known inside the company and has been at Amazon almost as long as I have. He will be an outstanding leader, and he has my full confidence.

This journey began some 27 years ago. Amazon was only an idea, and it had no name. The question I was asked most frequently at that time was, “What’s the internet?” Blessedly, I haven’t had to explain that in a long while.

Today, we employ 1.3 million talented, dedicated people, serve hundreds of millions of customers and businesses, and are widely recognized as one of the most successful companies in the world.

How did that happen? Invention. Invention is the root of our success. We’ve done crazy things together, and then made them normal. We pioneered customer reviews, 1-Click, personalized recommendations, Prime’s insanely-fast shipping, Just Walk Out shopping, the Climate Pledge, Kindle, Alexa, marketplace, infrastructure cloud computing, Career Choice, and much more. If you get it right, a few years after a surprising invention, the new thing has become normal. People yawn. And that yawn is the greatest compliment an inventor can receive.

I don’t know of another company with an invention track record as good as Amazon’s, and I believe we are at our most inventive right now. I hope you are as proud of our inventiveness as I am. I think you should be.

As Amazon became large, we decided to use our scale and scope to lead on important social issues. Two high-impact examples: our $15 minimum wage and the Climate Pledge. In both cases, we staked out leadership positions and then asked others to come along with us. In both cases, it’s working. Other large companies are coming our way. I hope you’re proud of that as well.

I find my work meaningful and fun. I get to work with the smartest, most talented, most ingenious teammates. When times have been good, you’ve been humble. When times have been tough, you’ve been strong and supportive, and we’ve made each other laugh. It is a joy to work on this team.

As much as I still tap dance into the office, I’m excited about this transition. Millions of customers depend on us for our services, and more than a million employees depend on us for their livelihoods. Being the CEO of Amazon is a deep responsibility, and it’s consuming. When you have a responsibility like that, it’s hard to put attention on anything else. As Exec Chair I will stay engaged in important Amazon initiatives but also have the time and energy I need to focus on the Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, The Washington Post, and my other passions. I’ve never had more energy, and this isn’t about retiring. I’m super passionate about the impact I think these organizations can have.

Amazon couldn’t be better positioned for the future. We are firing on all cylinders, just as the world needs us to. We have things in the pipeline that will continue to astonish. We serve individuals and enterprises, and we’ve pioneered two complete industries and a whole new class of devices. We are leaders in areas as varied as machine learning and logistics, and if an Amazonian’s idea requires yet another new institutional skill, we’re flexible enough and patient enough to learn it.

Keep inventing, and don’t despair when at first the idea looks crazy. Remember to wander. Let curiosity be your compass. It remains Day 1.

I've borrowed and dumbed down this chart from [this savant's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l97jbo/gamestop_big_picture_market_mechanics/).

As the free-flowing stock dries up (due to ppl buying and holding), the volatility increases. It becomes easier and easier to move the needle with less money. As long as you keep holding and buying, the volatility will only increase. **Expect huge swings in the next few days.**

Hedge funds know this. They tanked the stock this morning with ladder attacks. Right now they intentionally leveling the demand to keep the stock price stable; to make it look like the ride is over.

HOWEVER

The short float is still high, and the [volume has been steadily decreasing](https://i.imgur.com/eRH3S2b.png).

**Furthermore, GME just got put on the** [NSYE Short Sale Restrictions List](https://www.wallstreetdaily.com/2019/05/20/ssr-what-it-is-and-what-you-need-to-know/). Tomorrow (for one day only)  short-sale orders can only be executed at a price higher than the current best bid. This will put a huge damper on the shorties ability to lower the price.

Keep in mind the VW squeeze happened with far less short-interest than is currently in GME. The main problem is that retail investors, unlike huge firms, can't vacuum up all the supply fast enough, which enables the hf to slowly wiggle their way out buying up paper hands. They've likely exited their worst short positions and reshorted at a better price.

Some people are saying the squeeze might be more of a slow gradual upward pressure, rather than a sudden event. The truth is that the hedge funds are walking on a tightrope, and this stock is still extremely volatile. Any big movements in demand can drastically impact the price.

\------

Disclaimer: I am a poker player, not a day trader.  In poker, this is what we call an ""implied odds play"". The risk is relatively small for us bulls (relative to the short position), but the expected value is potentially huge if it works.  But these plays are still risky despite being +EV. **You have to be prepared to ride the swings and embrace the variance.**

*This is pure, uneducated speculation, not financial advice.*

TL/DR:

Grit your teeth and brace for swings. Shit's about to get nuts."

I don’t see the downside. You get even more famous than you already are and you make millions.

Considering people seem to be opening new short positions and the 800 calls are below 2.50. Now would be ideal for a coordinated group of whales to fuck the rest of the hedges and finish off the shorts. Be apart of history. Change investing as long as millions of individuals LIVES. Talk about good PR. I’m positive any whales or political figures would not regret this decision long term.

If this shit doesn’t moon, a lot of us are going to lose thousands, millions, fuck that—I’ve seen kids putting their college funds on this. Some will quit investing overall.

https://www.cnet.com/news/amazons-jeff-bezos-to-step-down-as-ceo-with-andy-jassy-taking-over/

Amazon's founder will remain with the company as an executive chairman, ceding the CEO responsibilities to the head of Amazon Web Services. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos will transition to the role of executive chair and Andy Jassy, the head of Amazon Web Services, will take over as CEO, in a surprise announcement nestled into its quarterly earnings report on Tuesday. 

The transition comes amid a time of turmoil for Amazon. While the company is reaping huge profits from consumers who are locked in their homes and more reliant on online services, it also faces increased regulatory scrutiny from lawmakers over the power it has over the retailers that use Amazon as an online storefront. 

That power has yielded huge profits. In the fourth quarter, net income rose to $7.2 billion, or $14.38 a share, from $3.3 billion, or $6.58 a share, a year ago. Amazon also posted net sales of $125.6 billion, an increase of 44% from the same period one year ago. That compares with Wall Street's estimate of $7.23 per share in earnings and $119.7 billion in net sales. 

Amazon previously said it expected sales to range between $112 billion and $121 billion for the fourth quarter, an increase of 28% to 38% over the last year. Analysts predicted the company would post $119.7 billion in revenue in the period, according to Yahoo Finance.

Holiday sales were projected to lift Amazon's revenue far over that of last year. E-commerce companies across the board experienced a boost from customers shopping from home during the third quarter of 2020, and Amazon was positioned to build off those numbers during the gift-purchasing bonanza.

Amazon headed into the last three months of tumultuous 2020 having generated enormous profits, even though it spent billions to address logistical problems presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand for online retail services surged as lockdowns kept customers away from stores. Shortages on goods and disruptions in shipping infrastructure affected retailers everywhere, and Amazon customers initially experienced delays in receiving their orders.

Additionally, the company faced the problem of keeping its vast workforce safe from the coronavirus. It said in October the virus had infected 20,000 US front-line employees, including grocery workers at Amazon-owned Whole Foods Market. The company said it rolled out safety and testing measures to protect workers, and that the numbers were lower than they would have projected based on the risks of infection in its facilities."

Everything’s that the hedgefunds have done since we beat them on AMC and GME last Wednesday is manipulate the market and tank the stock. The general consensus is that what has been going on is illegal stock price manipulation and the SEC has done nothing to protect retail stock buyers. 

I’m not saying someone should, but the SEC isn’t doing their job and we are paying the price for their negligence. Someone should hold them accountable, only way I see the people can do that is by suing them and holding tight until the Suits stop cheating, cuz we beat them and they’re salty.

We need to hold strong, nobody said this battle will be easy or that it was going to be won in one week. 
The media put the spotlight on silver to diverge the attention we were getting. We were 2 million last week now we are 8 million. We have grown in numbers and I’m sure among us are some spies and trolls and just curios people. But I am certain that we will prevail. We need to hold the $100 line tomorrow and get it back to $200 by Friday, the hedgefucks and their boyfriends will have to do some buying in order to cover. 
It is mathematically impossible that they have covered from 130% short interest to just 30% that’s fucking impossible. 
1) Up until Friday the short interest had rather increased
2) I know for sure they didn’t fucking trade over the weekend 
3) Retail investors, we are holding a big chunk of those stocks 

Wake up ! They are trying to make us surrender, it is impossible that they have covered their positions between Friday and today. 

Let’s hold the line, let’s get it back to $200-$300 levels. 

We might have taken the short ladder down but we will take the elevator going up.

DO NOT LET THOSE BASTARDS WIN, WE MUST REMAIN STRONG AND UNITED. THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING US. 

This is our legacy, we are being part of the history of investing and finance. We can be remembered as the ones who stood up against the big guy and won. 

We owe this to everyone who has lost before and has had their dreams crushed by the suits.

“How a DAO could take the GME case to a different level

 While it may rather seem to be a post for r/ethtrader, this is a post in which I try to make the case for how a DAO could supercharge what [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) did with GME: a collaborative attack on a billion Dollar hedgefund.

I didn't know wallstreetbets before the short squeeze of the GameStop stock and as many people I had to read into what was actually happening. Skimming through media reports the narrative seemed to be plain and simple ""Reddit rascals tricking Wallstreet suits"". However, if you follow the topic closely on Reddit, you can clearly see that for some people including [u/deepfuckingvalue](https://www.reddit.com/u/deepfuckingvalue/) (I highly recommend to check out this post on [r/video](https://www.reddit.com/r/video/) featuring his original analysis) this was neither a get-rich-quick scheme nor some joke. People really liked the idea to have the hedgefunds by the balls.

I personally don't think that this sentiment will eventually last (although I hope to be proved wrong). There may be even more people on the Subreddit claiming to hold with diamond hands, however overall there is a lack of proof that people DID hold, contributing to an increasing lack of trust - because people don't know for sure what the majority plans to do or is already doing, people lose the ability to act as a collective.

Now, dealing with a lack of trust even in an environment where people are highly suspicious of each other is somewhat the core feature of cryptocurrencies. A DAO that is able to buy stocks based on the vote of a group of people would allow investors to not only join forces but also to effectively eradicate the prisoners' dilemma that GME stock holders currently experience. This provides retail users with unprecedented powers.

Of course, joining forces is possible for everyone, retail users and bankers - but the wallstreetbets case shows that in the end a viral social media movement can be pretty powerful, at least relatively. The people who would join forces by adding funds to a DAO gain mutual trust and the ability to share risk, but they likewise share the gains and by doing so reduce them heavily. This makes it much less attractive for those who are mainly interested in multiplying investments short-term - people with a political agenda (flip the bird to Wallstreet) won't see this as a problem..

What would be needed is a DAO with a bridge to the stock market. Not as easy, but still possible in the very near future. I am half-sure, we might see this of solution within the next year.”"

By Svea Herbst-Bayliss

BOSTON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Prominent hedge funds including Dan Sundheim's D1 Capital Partners and Steve Cohen's Point72 Asset Management chalked up deep losses last month as hotly traded Gamestop hurt returns while others like Jason Mudrick's Mudrick Capital posted gains during January's turbulent trading, investors in the funds said on Tuesday.

The bulk of January's hedge fund returns were influenced by a late-month rally in unloved stocks including GameStop and AMC Entertainment. The Standard & Poor's 500 index ended January down 1.1%, with the vaccine rollout and stimulus plans a large focus for the month.

Melvin Capital, one of the biggest funds betting on a drop in GameStop's share price lost 53% in January when the stock price was forced higher by an army of retail investors using the Robinhood online trading app.

Other funds like Point72, which invests with Melvin Capital, lost nearly 9% and D1 tumbled 20% while Maplelane, which was also short GameStop, lost 45%, people familiar with the returns said. David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital lost 11%.

Citadel lost 3%, a person familiar with the returns said on Sunday. Balyasny Asset Management, was down 0.5%, an investor in the fund said.

William Ackman's Pershing Square Holdings, which holds only a handful of stocks and does not traditionally bet that stock prices will drop by shorting, lost 1.3% in January as many stocks sold off amid the trading turbulence.

But there were winners too. Mudrick Capital, seen as a hero to the retail crowd for having rescued AMC Entertainment with clever financing - the firm is not a short seller - posted its best month ever with a 9.8% gain after a 11.2% gain in 2020, a person familiar with the returns said.

Dinakar Singh's Axon Capital, which bet last year that a vaccine would soon boost travel, posted an 8.5% gain in January and is up another 8% in the first two days of February, a person familiar with the returns said.

And Tiger Global Management which last year earned $10.4 billion, started 2021 with a 1% gain in January.

Representatives for the funds either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.

Could someone explain to me how we know that the hedge funds haven't figured out how to cut their losses and actually profit from it? (It just seems more realistic in my view of the world.)

I'm holding 14 shares of GME @ 170, and I'm trying to remain hopeful, but I'm just hearing a lot of talk on one side about how the shorts have been covered, how reddit doesn't only has 20% of the stocks, and that the squeeze is over.

And the other side being people who have spent millions of dollars on this and are still holding, information that is being speculated as ""attacks"", and basically people saying ""DIAMOND HANDS, HOLD TO THE MOON,""

How does anybody know if the shorts were covered or not? Do they still have to buy back their shorts?  The price is way down. Couldn't they have covered at this price?

I feel I am being misinformed because I'm panic reading every comment on every thread to try to get some insight. It feels like the momentum is falling, and my concern is rising.

I feel like I'm seeing a lot of people selling but people are still adamant that GME will go to $1000+

1612301673.0,17,Want to transfer that sweet sweet $GME away from the Sherriff of Nottingham? without being tied up for 5-8 business days?,"#PARTIAL ACCOUNT TRANSFERS FROM ROBINHOOD TO TD AMERITRADE WILL NOT FREEZE YOUR SHARES LIKE A FULL ACCOUNT TRANSFER WILL

so like the smooth brain I am, I initiated an account transfer using the TD Ameritrade app to bring my full Robbinghood account over to TDA. on saturday I get a message that my Rh account was deactivated while the full account transfer went through. 50 GME shares locked up for 5-8 business days.

on monday (yesterday) I call TDA customer support and ask about the status of my transfer. the support agent told me TDA had cancelled my account transfer because I had some shares in a random Chinese penny stock that they wouldn't accept. problem is my Rh account is still deactivated so I can't trade any of my portfolio.

the TDA lady tells me i should just do a partial account transfer of the ""less fringe stocks"" (her words lmao) only. so I immediately intiate one, transferring 4 of my holdings from Rh to TDA.

TODAY. Robinhood reactivated my account this morning at 8:22am. I called TDA again to make sure the partial account transfer was still coming through and the person I talked to told me it was and I could expect it to get there Friday.

I told him this tale and asked him if I could expect my Rh account to freeze up again now that another transfer had started but he told me only full account transfers result in one becoming frozen

even though i have access to my 50 shares again and I'm down 15k I'm still holding. 💎🤲💎🤲💎🤲💎🤲"

The clients of the hedge funds can start the squeeze once their paper losses get to be too big and they all start crying on Facebook.

1612301578.0,54,The State of Our Tendies,"**TLDR**: hold and wait for Thursday/Friday - buy if you like the stock, otherwise go jack off for a couple days and come back to lots of tendies 

Today we saw our precious $GME fall to a level we have not seen since last Thursday - and then ever further beyond that point. We entered AH today at a lowly $90 per share. We may be entering our darkest hour yet.

Today we also got some good news too - the Mark Cuban AMA went well, and AMC theaters are reopening soon! Some executives are sharing that we may get $GME to over $1,000 soon, and if you compare our graphs with the Volkswagen graph from 2008, we have the M shape, we have the dip, and now we await the spike.

Let's get into what today meant for us. This has been a second hard day this week. Many are seeing either massive losses or unrealized gains evaporating. The media is delivering article after article on GameStop, literally every time the price falls a single dollar it seems. Today we have learned some new things - some of you may have read this, some of you may have learned this the hard way, and some of you might not accept this: if YOU personally can afford to hold this stock, you hold. Why would you sell? We have seen where this can go, we have seen how badly these guys are bleeding, we have seen the stock bounce from 450 to 124 to 300 in a span of 24 hours.

As of today, there are only 2.5 days for Wall Street to cover their shorts. This is a wave that is building up slowly and we are not going to let it go. We could potentially fuck Melvin and the gang THIS WEEK. In another post I made earlier today I had mentioned Thursday as my estimation of t-day (tendies day) - I still stand by that: Thursday will be the beginning, but Thursday will not be the end of anything. Posts today have mentioned that Melvin may be committing massive fraud by illegally covering their shorts - and I believe them.

As investors, we control the market by holding. The people we are fighting against, Melvin and Gang, they can't do this forever. Hell, they probably can't do this for another week. They have spent the last few days sowing dissent in our community, monitoring everything we do, and trying to get the upper hand yet again. The only problem for them - they can't. As long as WE hold our shares, they have already lost. They would need to get people like DFV to sell in order to make a dent in our morale.

**So what does any of what I just said mean?**

We are gonna see status quo tomorrow. Buy the fire sale if you like the stock, if you don't, don't. Thursday or Friday, we start seeing a fire get lit underneath Melvin's hairy nuts and we will watch it spread viciously, all while making ourselves a quick buck.

**Will there be a lot of time for us all to get out?**

Like anything like this, some will make more than others. Selling lowers the price of a stock. If you need $10,000 for a life saving surgery, pull out at $10,000. We joke a lot about how everyone needs to hold, but most people will not hold it against you. We get that sometimes the money IS more important than the cause.

**What if it doesn't happen this Thursday/Friday?**

Then we wait. This is a game of patience. To the patient go the tendies!

**What is a short ladder attack?**

Hedgefunds bid on each other's stock, lowering the price artificially. There is little volume on these trades - since nobody can buy, it plummets the price. The only effect it has is if we sell, which not many people are doing.

**Why are so many people still holding? Why didn't we cash out earlier?**

This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. This event has the potential to change lives and change rules. Personally, as long as I sell over 80$, I won't be sad.

Position: 25 shares @ 80$

1612301578.0,120,Addressing Misinformation and Bad Advice as I see it,"I’m just gonna come out straight and say it: you are hurting yourself more than helping when you spread information that is ignorant and not based in reality.

Last Thursday and Friday, there was all of this talk of a Gamma Squeeze, “it’s going to happen, oh yeah definitely so long as we close above the magic and imaginary number of $320. Don’t worry, shorts won’t cover until Tuesday so you can be patient, wait it out”

Every fucking time you degenerates give a deadline, you create another opportunity for disappointment. Stop it. No one knows what’s going to happen or when. 

Yes, monkeys strong together, but also monkeys stupid together. It’s a fine sentiment. The culture stuff is less so.

Is this subreddit really going to turn into such a dumbass fucking echo chamber that every single time the stock goes down we scream “short ladder!” “Market manipulation!” “Fake news!”

Because while all of these things are possible, it’s also a FUCKING VOLATILE MARKET. And every single time someone says that something in it is guaranteed, they’re setting themselves up for failure.

So yeah, FUCKING hold, obviously. But don’t gamble away your life savings.

Obviously but the dip. But ask yourself where you genuinely want and believe the stock you’re investing in to be.

Also. “Shorts have x days to cover, it’ll go up then!!”
And “GME is now on the short restriction list!! That means that we literally can’t lose now” are fucking stupid. Not based in reality. Look, we all want our tendies. We all want them to be guaranteed. But this is a war of attrition.

And there’s no such thing as guaranteed success.

If you like the stock, buy it.  If you think, based on a whim, or research, or for any fucking reason that convinces you that a stock is going to go up, then buy the stock. Look at DFV: He didn’t invest because he thought a massive short squeeze was going to drive his value investment into the 8 or 9 digits, and he didn’t sell when he was at almost 50mil- you know why?

Because he believes in the fucking company and isn’t here to get a quick buck.

Buy low. Sell high. Fomo is fucking stupid. 

And make your own god damned decision.

One of my favorite games is blackjack. Its slow, its relaxing, you can sit at the table and just kind of shoot the shit and throw a few bucks down on each hand.

Say you go to a casino tomorrow and all you have in your pocket is 300 dollars. You took out a bit more than you can afford, but you dont plan on spending it all. You're Jon Favreau from Swingers.

You sit at the blakjack table and everyone is telling you how hot the dealer has been. They tell you that you should bet big because you will definitely win.

Dealer throws down the cards, and you get 11.

DOUBLE DOWN! everyone says. But, you put half your whole wad on this hand and doubling down would clean you out. You know you only get one card, but everyone (including the dealer) is telling you to DOUBLE DOWN! There are still a TON of face cards left! You cant lose! You ALWAYS double down on 11 and split your aces. ALWAYS!

You do it. You get your card. Its a 5.

Dealer hits and gets 19. You lose.

Whose fault is it? Its not the dealer's fault. Its not the fault of the other people. Hell, it isn't even the fault of the dude before you who hit on 14 even though the dealer was showing a 6, taking your face card.

Its your fault.

This is gambling.

Ultimately, you are making a bet. This bet may pan out. There are a lot of stats that show it might. There are some that show it wont. Experts are saying you'll make a ton. Experts are saying you'll lose it all.

At the end of the day, you are a gambler, not an investor. Treat this like a blackjack table. Are you comfortable doubling down with all the money in your pocket? If that money were gone tomorrow, what would happen?

There is a reason I spent 1K on the stock. That is because I love to gamble, and when I hit a casino 1K is my limit.

With COVID, I cant go to a casino any more. But I can do this. And I took my limit, Doubled down on 11, and I am anxiously waiting for the dealer to lay my card down.

Problem is, the dude before me took my face card. That's OK though...makes it more exciting.

This is not financial advice.

I just love the stock.

And blackjack."

My thoughts in this are based in continued general interest in AMC due to the short squeezes, but also the recent injection of cash the company received, and the re-opening of AMC theaters, and Robinhood’s lightening of buying restrictions this afternoon, allowing the purchase of up to 1250 new/maximum shares.

With this in mind, I think that a fair amount of retail investors will be willing to buy shares, and, imo, result in some decent gains higher than its current hover around $6-8."

It has NEVER been a better deal for a late comer and if you sold today, that is probably you. So please, for the sake of future you (as well as the rest of the autistic simian brothers and sisters on WSB) buy back in and strap that ape flight helmet back on.

1612300806.0,66,Three SEC Violations Regarding GME Short Trades,"Credit: u/President_Wolfe

***TLDR: I think I've found at least 3 violations of SEC regulations?***

Compiling some research, post not complete but being used for dumping SEC regulations that appear to have been violated based on last weeks GME shenanigans:

1) ***Rule 201 – Short Sale Price Test Circuit Breaker.*** Rule 201 generally requires trading centers to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to prevent the execution or display of a short sale at an impermissible price when a stock has triggered a circuit breaker by experiencing ***a price decline of at least 10 percent in one day.*** *Once the circuit breaker in Rule 201 has been triggered, the price test restriction* ***will apply to short sale orders in that security for the remainder of the day and the following day,*** unless an exception applies.

2) ***Rule 203(b)(1) and (2) – Locate Requirement.*** Regulation SHO requires a broker-dealer to have ***reasonable grounds to believe that the security can be borrowed*** so that it can be delivered on the date delivery is due before effecting a short sale order in any equity security.[[7]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn7) ***This “locate” must be made and documented prior to effecting the short sale.***

3) ***Rule 204 – Close-out Requirement.*** Rule 204 requires brokers and dealers that are participants of a registered clearing agency[[8]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn8) to take action to close out failure to deliver positions. Closing out requires the broker or dealer to purchase or borrow securities of like kind and quantity. 

The participant must close out a failure to deliver for a short sale transaction by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+4. If a participant has a failure to deliver that the participant can demonstrate on its books and records resulted from a long sale, or that is attributable to bona fide market making activities, the participant must close out the failure to deliver by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the third consecutive settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+6. 

If the position is not closed out, the broker or dealer and any broker or dealer for which it clears transactions (for example, an introducing broker)[[9]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn9) may not effect further short sales in that security without borrowing or entering into a bona fide agreement to borrow the security (known as the “pre-borrowing” requirement) until the broker or dealer purchases shares to close out the position and the purchase clears and settles. 

In addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO ***requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out failures to deliver in securities with large and persistent failures to deliver,*** referred to as “threshold securities,” ***if the failures to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days.***[[10]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn10) 

Threshold securities are equity securities[[11]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn11) that have an aggregate fail to deliver position for five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency (e.g., National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC)); ***totaling 10,000 shares or more; and equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer's total shares outstanding.*** 

As provided in Rule 203 of Regulation SHO, threshold securities are included on a list disseminated by a self-regulatory organization (“SRO”). Although as a result of compliance with Rule 204, generally a participant’s fail to deliver positions will not remain for 13 consecutive settlement days, ***if, for whatever reason, a participant of a registered clearing agency has a fail to deliver position at a registered clearing agency in a threshold security for 13 consecutive settlement days, the requirement to close-out such position under Rule 203(b)(3) remains in effect.***

Still reading through it myself but it seems that there have been violations of ***SHO Rules 201,203, and 204, any input would be greatly appreciated!***

***TLDR;***

***1) NO SHORTS should have been executed Thursday when GME dropped down to $132 because it fell more than 10%***

***2) No new shorts should have been issued because there's no reasonable belief that they could find actual stock to lend given 140% short float, and I doubt they secured it PRIOR to issuing new stock***

***3)They should have already executed the failed to delver shorts ASAP because of the high number of FTD's and the high number of shorted shares***

This is not coincidence as the hedge funds are clearly giving us the middle finger saying they can do whatever the fuck they want without recourse.

I'm way down over 365K for GME, I'm not selling because I'm way past my threshold of misery at this point and I do believe GME is still a viable business (and hoping Cohen takes over soon enough).

Still, I understand we're up against the entire system and I'm not putting too much hope into recouping my losses here.

I'm still going to buy shares here and there while I try to lick my wounds and sit on the sidelines for a bit. I'm going to anticipate the next major attack will be the short interest report, where they'll manipulate the numbers someway somehow.

Overall, I'd caution every that it will probably get worse; before it gets better.  
Either way, I ain't selling not one fucking share and will be adding where possible.

You might think that you would never FOMO into a stock or you might be wondering if this applies to you. Ask yourself these questions to find out if you need the checklist. 

- Have you ever thought of buying some super hyped shares at ATH?

- Have you thought about joining ‘the team’ in the squeeze on stockthatshallnotbenamed? (Ps. there are no teams in retail investing it’s every man for himself)

- Do you use WallStreetBets? 

If you answered yes to any of the precursor questions below then you are in danger of a FOMO trade and need this checklist. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HOW NOT TO FOMO CHECKLIST 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Ask yourself why you want to buy the stock. Are you jealous of others gains? Do you want to be part of that weeks big thing? If yes to either then do not buy. Jealous trading is bad trading. 

2. Warren Buffet said “be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy.” Ask yourself if people are being greedy with the stock you want to buy, do not buy if they are. 

3. Ask yourself “am I being a sheep?” Sheep do not make money on the stock market, they don’t even understand the stock market, they are sheep. Don’t be a sheep. 

4. Where did you see the stock? If it was on the news don’t buy it. If it’s trending on one of the subreddits then it’s probably too late. 

5. Is it often appearing on the subreddit and being regularly pushed by the same small crowd? Watch out cause without proof they are probably bag holders hoping to pass the bag to you. 

6. Can you explain to somebody what the company does and why it is a good idea to buy it? If not then you shouldn’t buy it yourself. 

7. Is the market mostly red or mostly green that week? Sell on green weeks and buy on red weeks. It might feel like the other way around at the time but that’s emotional trading. 
8. Is it a meme stock? If yes then be an early adopter or don’t adopt at all. 

9. Have you got spare capital? If money is no issue to you or if you are making a small punt that won’t harm your finances then go ahead. If you are making a big, late move into a meme stock then you’ll be seeing red. 

10. Does it have emojis in the DD’s? If yes then disregard all previous steps and bet your house on it."

I know the F word is shunned here and I don't use it very much, but the FUNDAMENTALS ARE FUCKING CRAZY. With these fundamentals the price it's trading at it is criminal. After consulting the Bloomberg terminal, the monkey analysts have a price target of $235 and the majority of them have buy ratings on the stock. In addition, Dollar General has an estimated revenue of +20%  YoY and a P/E ratio of 19. Overall the sentiment on DG is very bullish, and If you don't give a shit about what the analysts say the value of the stock is shown in the fundamentals, they are just confirmation bias.

This has been a rough week so far. GME is closing at around 90, and either you are seeing massive losses, or the unrealized gains you had evaporate right in front of your eyes. The media is spewing out 200 articles per day saying 'Gamestop is over', and that anyone who stays in the stock is retarded.

But it's simple. As Mark Cuban himself said,  

>If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.  
>  
>Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of.

And ask yourself, **what WSB is really made of?** Is it just plain autistic and retarded traders? Yes, but we also have our Diamond community. People that are actively trying to beat the market, that do their due diligence, and that want to bathe in chicken tendies.

And we have seen post after post of their DD, reinforcing over and over what we were always here for.   
And let me tell you: **Nothing has changed.**

# The short term plan (SHORT SQUEEZE)

Alright, I'll bust out the numbers quick:   
[https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=gme&submit=Short+Quote™](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=gme&submit=Short+Quote™) says that the Short Interest is stil  61,780,000 shares, or 120%. The shorters have obviously refilled their shorts, knowing that their **market manipulation has driven the price down wonders.**

**Their greatest hope** to **avoid** the *Squozening* is to scare off everyone who is holding. They won't stop dumping the stock using everything they have to keep the price away from execution princes, and **avoid getting gamma squeezed again.**

**But,** this doesn't change that 120% of short interest is still insane. They have RELOADED their own failure, failing to acknowledge the power the retail trading community posseses. 

In fact, the stock has been put in the NYSE restricted list of Short selling. They quite literally can't short this stock anymore. So once this rises again, the MMs have NO REASON to start dropping the price again, as they can't benefit once more from shorting on the way down.

This week we are extremely weak as a community due to the immense number of traders having to transfer to Fidelity/Schwab/other brokers, and the MMs have clearly made great use of this. Hell, Drivewealth, one of the biggest clearing brokers for international traders (such as myself), restricted buying GME, and have said to be able to clear buying GME very soon

But as the fund transfers are complete, and Robinhood acquires more capital to realize their trades, and the other brokers lift restrictions, GME will MOST DEFINITIVELY skyrocket. Once the rocket starts going off again, ALL THE FOMO FROM PEOPLE WHO MISSED 300+ WILL SHOW!

**So the SHORT SQUEEZE STILL CAN HAPPEN.** 

# The long term plan (RYAN COHEN IS GOD, Q4 is still coming)

Don't forget that we still have Ryan Cohen on board, and with expected record sales from this console cycle, Gamestop is very far away from going bankrupt. 

Remember: The ideal situation for shorts is a bankruptcy/delisting.

Ryan Cohen is still in, the Quarterly report for GME is still coming, and the long term prospects of the company are still FUCKING BULLISH.  Even if we can't force a squeeze in february, long term changes done to the company can still trigger a short squeeze. In fact, most of the rise of GME so far has been done through investors buying in, not through short squeezes. 

Yes, it is fact that many shorts have covered (At BILLIONS of losses), but this doesn't change our fundamental thesis: *Gamestop + Ryan Cohen = Rokit mun*. The VW squeeze happened after DAYS of red, you better believe we can end up waiting for a month for the squoze.

1612299992.0,56,Stop buying AMD Calls,"Hey guys,

A lot of you don't know me, as I don't usually post here. I'm usually over at /r/AMD_stock posting DD there. But I'm posting here because the recent activity in the stock led me to realize a huge, glaring problem with the stock's performance and it's latest earnings.

Let me step back a bit first.

Last Friday the stock plummeted 12% after posting the best earnings it possibly could have posted. At AMD_Stock, we usually brush off the post-earnings crush and continue our bull plays (or the smarter ones wait until after earnings to get back in). But this post-earnings crush was different. For this earnings, there was zero fundamental reason why the stock should go down. The earnings were excellent, the margins were excellent, the guidance for 1Q21 was incredible, and the guidance for FY21 was almost double what the street was expecting. Yet the stock still went down. It went down from $94 pre-earnings to almost $84....*on the best possible news*. 

What more could the street have wanted? Did shareholders want a +60% revenue increase YoY, instead of just +40%? Did they want 3x year-over-year revenue in 1Q20, instead of just 2x? Did the street expect us to beat our FY20 targets by more than they anticipated? Did investors want the fab capacity issues to be completely resolved earlier than 2Q21? Did they want Milan to be released earlier than March '21? Was there any reason to sell off after an earnings as incredible as that? You could even see the [bewilderment](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/27/full-interview-with-amd-ceo-lisa-su-on-q4-results-product-pipeline-demand-and-more.html) on Lisa Su's face as she started an interview with CNBC the morning after.

Why? [No financial news](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-q4-2020-advanced-micro-devices-earnings/), not even [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/26/amd-amd-earnings-q4-2020.html), could pin a 'reason' on the drop.

And then I realized the problem. It's you.

You buy the cheapest AMD weeklies you can and hold them through earnings like it can't go tits up. You hope that AMD beats all expectations, and that the stock price skyrockets on your tendie-train choo-choo-ing to the moon. Post-earnings you sell your OTM calls just as they go ITM to some suck-ass broker-dealer, and go do some hookers and blow and make a golden shrine to Mama Su and thank her for your amazing luck. Good thing those stupid broker-dealers were so desperate to buy your calls just before expiry.. you would have bankrupted them if you held on to them any longer!

The day after earnings comes and you wake up and the price is down 5% and dropping. You sell immediately, because you can't see it recovering by Friday, when your calls expire. This causes MMs to sell the shares they bought as a hedge against selling you your calls. Stock goes down further. Other people sell their calls, and MMs sell more shares to reduce the hedge even more, on and on until Friday expiration rolls around and bag-holders let their calls expire worthless, along with their hopes and dreams.

Stop losing at AMD! How? *INVEST PROPERLY*

How? Buy and hold shares or LEAPS. Stop chasing the mythical overnight gains. AMD is a *long-term success* and it has [room to double](https://old.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/l6jijo/rosenblatt_securities_says_amd_could_double_in/). DO IT NOW - Price is recovering from the crush, but are still trading at a [20% discount to analyst consensus](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast), and at a 10% discount from it's recent highs.

Conclusion: This is a better buy-and-hold than GME, BB, or anything. AMD has grown continuously in the past 5 years and, if you read the DD on /r/AMD_stock, you'll discover that it also has an incredible growth roadmap the next 5 years.

Stop losing. Buy shares and double your money.

But let's actually stop pretending like he owes us anything and figure out what might be going on in that brilliant apetastic head.

His [sarcastic tweet today](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1356639476454424580) really caught my attention. At this point, he's either bluffing or truly not concerned.

**Why would he bluff?**

1. This blew up (culturally/frenzy), hedgies got out of this using the dirtiest of tricks that even he didn't see in the middle of all the hype-buying, it squoze out from under us mixed in with all the hype and tricks, and he doesn't see it yet.

2. This blew up, and saw the squeeze, and still held out of principle (in this case he wouldn't be bluffing technically, just wouldn't have the goal of maximizing gains, which I assume is his goal).

3. He sees it (now) but missed his exit and is doubling down because FUCK and why not / who knows / embarrassed etc.

None of those options really make any sense to me coming from the guy who called this so brilliantly a long time ago. If you have other theories on why his tweet today might have been a bluff, please comment.

**Why isn't he concerned**

1. He doesn't think the new squeeze data isn't right, shorts are still short and he doesn't buy the S3 update.

2. He has a pre-defined exit strategy no matter what happens that hasn't triggered yet.

3. He isn't planning on selling, ever. 

*or*

4. His stoic ass did not get caught up in the frenzy at all. He saw the hype building, he realized that this might blow up to hundreds of dollars on that hype, come back down, and life would go on. Even if GME goes back down to $40-60 we are still up for the month. If a squeeze is still on the table, this frenzy we are going through really won't matter that much if we are looking at this in terms of months at a time. Dude is clearly patient af, maybe he proactively embraced emotionally for this violent roller coaster that nobody truly expected, and scheduled today's tweet a week ago knowing it would likely crash back to earth and still settle at a very good price relative to where its been. 

These are just some random ideas, but I am really curious about this. I have the most respect in the world for this dude especially after that tweet today, but I think it may be worth a discussion looking at the possibilities on why he actually hasn't sold.

Please add your own ideas. I'm dumb, headed to the moon, and ofc this is all pure speculation."

1612299356.0,206,My Rant About Not Giving Up,"Like many OG members of this sub, I realize things have changed around here. Daily loss porn posts have turned into large text posts of motivation / $GME speculation / insane $GME profit. Like many people here, I kinda like the direction things are heading in right now. That being said, we all need to start putting in work.

So many people who don't even own shares are commenting in the Daily Discussion threads causing quite a few people to feel a semblance of doubt. So many bots / interns are trying to sway the hivemind into being scared. Neither party realizes, as sad as it may be, none of us here can read.

I hold 25 shares of GME, I went all in with my savings @ $80. Yes, I can afford to lose that amount of money. No, I am not complaining about anything money related in this post. I, like many others, have seen our accounts reach numbers that before last week, we didn't even think possible. Mine personally hit a high of $12,000 or so. I have never had that much money in my life. Did I cash out? No, of course not.

Come today, where I have less than $500 profit, and I am still very happy with how everything is going. I'm going to start telling some information that some people are going to question: on Thursday we will prevail. Thursday is an important day - I predict tomorrow we will see status quo with the last few days - but on Thursday, everything changes for us.

To begin with, it is the day in which I become one year more retarded. Secondly, the phase of the moon that night correlates perfectly to millions being added to our side. Third - hear me out - we are too fucking powerful for these Hedge Fund looking assholes to withstand 4 days of this shit.

This is where we fight, this is where we stand, and this is where we will prevail. I will see you on the moon Thursday / Friday, young retards.

1612299312.0,520,"GME: the Big Wave is building up, can you feel it? 🌊🚀🌊","Diamond holders, tendie lovers, autists of all countries, GME gang. Listen to me when I speak these words (mods pls don't delete). Today is the worst it can get. We hit a floor at $80 due to short ladder attacks over the last few days. $80 is the neutral price target that the guys over at [www.gmedd.com](https://www.gmedd.com) assigned, realistically it can't drop lower without it literally being an undervalued stock. No one of GME gang is selling, so stop pointing fingers at eachother. Only margin call marvins are forced to sell, may their hands rest in paper. Overall this is blatant artifical price lowering that will come back to bite the hedge funds in the ass eventually. Just wait and see.

Let's cut to the chase: everyone that saw their unrealised gains evaporate over the last couple of days and turn into losses needs to chill the fuck out. The best thing to compare this to in your mind is a tsunami. **At first, there is an earthquake**. This is our subreddit getting GME on our radars and massively buying in, this has become an international movement against corporate greed. The shock was felt throughout the entire financial ecosystem.  
**Then because of the earthquake, the ocean pulls back from the shores.** This is the hedge funds attacking us with all kinds of illegal manipulation right now to try and pull us apart, they try to make us sell our stock at prices that are below five digits (what are they thinking?). **But what the hedge funds forget is that when the ocean pulls back, a big wave is forming silently in the distance**. A wave (the MOASS) with such a colossal force that it will wipe out anything standing in its way. And when that wave hits, there will be hell to pay.

You guys only need to **diamond hold on for your dear lives** while the wave builds. I know things seem bleak right now, but there is no way the squeeze doesn't happen at this point. Remember, the hedge funds initially got in at a price of $20 and pushed it down to $4. The $80 floor is still 4 times their initial buy in price. Of course, over the times old shorters sold their positions to new shorters, but the positions remain the same. Those loons are still betting for a GameStop bankruptcy. Hedge funds have been bleeding ever since the price recovered to $20 and continue to bleed at this very moment, eventually they will have to throw in the towel. Despite what you may read on this forum from very motivated autists with good intentions, it is impossible to know when exactly the squeeze will happen because that is up to the hedgies themselves. **All I know is that right now the tsunami alarms are going off and all hedge funds must be evacuated. Because the Big Wave is building up at this very moment and will inevitably hit the shores.** Thanks for reading this until the end. Stay healthy, stay safe and most of all: hold GME because *you like the stock*.

1612299213.0,1136,GME holders are basically in the best situation. Hear me out.,"Think about it. All that's left are diamond handers. There's essentially no point in selling for *anyone* still holding as the upside is likely far greater than the downside as a result of losing so much money already. Paperhands are out of the way and would have sold long ago so there's less need to worry about existing GME holders selling (more confidence). Assuming WSB continues to hold/buy and is prepared for weeks to months of holding/buying, theoretically, this stock will catapult upwards. Worst case scenario is the hedge funds decide to cover sooner. In that case, there's a good shot of making back your money/profiting. Best case scenario, they refuse to cover, the stock slowly goes to the moon, and we're back in tumultuous short squeeze scenario, again, but this time everyone has moved to a broker that isn't pure trash. There's still around 55 percent of float shorted and I suspect it'll increase.

And here's the kicker:

Once the stock starts to rise, however long that takes, guess what's going to happen? All the paperhanded folk are going to jump right back in, or at least a lot of them. Guess what else? All those paperhanded folk likely made quite a bit of money on the way up the first time, therefore, more capital. GUESS WHAT ELSE ELSE? This just essentially means you can theoretically make even MORE MONEY by lowering your cost basis. GUESS WHAT WHAT ELSE ELSE ELSE? Uh, nothing, that's it.

1612298702.0,46,Unjustifiable Bearish," Macy’s is a department store operator with a market cap of $4.7B. If you look at its business the four years prior to 2020, it was fairly stable with revenues during that 4 year period ranging from $25.3-25.9B with EBITDA greater than $2.1B for each year during that period. They were aggressively deleveraging during this period having reduced debt from $7.6B to $4.2B (these number exclude capital leases). Then in 2020, the COVID crisis occurred and Macy’s business suffered mightily as stores were closed due to local restrictions. Management took a number of actions such as raising additional cash, suspending the dividend, cutting CAPEX, closing unprofitable stores, reducing inventory and cutting SG&A. In 2020, sales will likely end up being down about 30% to $17.8B with EBITDA being slightly positive (\~$50M). But I would argue that 2020 will be the trough in revenues and earnings for Macy’s. As we move into 2021 and the pandemic mitigates, people will return to shopping in stores and Macy’s sales will start to show Y/Y positive comps as they progress through the year. Current average analyst expectations for 2021 call for M to make $0.65/share.  


However, I believe that Wall Street is way too bearish on this company. Currently 6 analysts rate Macy’s as a sell with one brave analyst going positive on the company in December with a Buy rating. But if you look at the last two earnings releases, Macy’s blew away analyst’s weak expectations by wide margins with upside surprises of $0.96/share in Q2 and $0.60/share in Q3. With this bearish slant, I believe M will blow away expectations again in Q4. The average analyst expectation only calls for earnings of $0.04/share in the holiday quarter. But I project they will make just shy of $1/share (ex. items) assuming sales come in about $6.7B. Part of the reason for the bearish stance is many of these analyst’s clients are short Macy’s stock.  


One of the biggest arguments shorts make is the Macy’s in too indebted with high interest debt. But at the end of Q3, M had $1.55B in cash on the balance sheet and had net debt of only $3.8B. The cash level will only improve coming out of the holiday quarter where EBITDA will be greater than $700M. When revenues return to normalized levels, the debt level is <2x EBITDA. With the cash on the balance sheet, they have ample liquidity to cover interest payments of $80M/quarter. Also, no significant debt maturities are coming due in the next couple years that are not already covered by existing cash and future cash flows. Some of M’s debt is secure by their real estate holdings which is valued at double the current market cap of the company.  


When I look at how they compare against competitors, their stock price currently is priced at a discount. Macy’s sells for a P/S of 0.24 compared with Kohl’s (0.42), Dillard’s (0.43) or Nordstrom’s (0.51). One could argue that share price should be selling for around $30/share to have comparable valuations. But I would argue that Macy’s should have a higher multiple due to their e-Commerce business which made up 38% of sales in the most recent quarter growing at a 27% Y/Y clip. Macy’s is currently the 10th largest e-Commerce retailer in the US (Amazon is #1 and sports a 4.5 P/S). If I look at those on the list that are slightly bigger players, all are brick & mortars and sport much higher P/S ratios, #7 Best Buy (0.62), #8 Target (1.04) and #9 Costco (0.91). If valued with a similar P/S ratio, Macy’s should sell for $38-65/share.  


Part of the reason Macy’s share price is depressed is because it is heavily shorted. Currently over 28% of the float is short the stock. The shorts are unjustifiable bearish on a company that is undervalued compared to its peer even though has a greater e-Commerce presence and will be returning to profitability in 2021 post COVID. But I think other players in the market will exploit this heavily shorted situation in the near term by pushing the shares higher. Heavy buying of Feb. 19 calls would suggest the price will be pushed higher ahead of the company’s earnings release which will likely happen late in February. If Q4 earnings exceed analyst expectations by a large margin as I expect, we could see a short squeeze due to the heavy short interest.  


We will see what happens with Macy’s this month and longer term. My contention is it is worth a lot more than $15/share, more realistically it is worth $30-40/share, which is why I am long."

1612298437.0,94,"This is a new game now, but the game is still on!","So let's take a look back at last week - there was a ton of attention on GME, and it was because of that in large part that the stock spiked so quickly.  Then the RH crap happened and a lot of short was covered, blowing up the stock price.  It recovered some on Friday as positions were covered before close of the week.  

Something else happened though - they started shorting even more.  They saw that a squeeze happened and believed that would end it and it would all be done.  I don't think there are ladder attacks, any secret formula, or any other conspiracies going on.  What is happening is we are in the middle of a battle between various whales.  The more of us there are, the more the balance shifts towards the longs.  Looking at short interest, it is still >50% so that is good for the squeeze.  But we have to realize - this isn't the same game anymore.

The old shorts have been covered, we are now up against the new shorts.  It is still incredibly heavily shorted.  The old reason of the stock blowing up was the exponentially increasing media attention bringing on new buyers.  They are gone now.  What happens next?  

I don't think we have to dig super deeply into key dates, failure to delivers, expirations.  I think the squeeze can start again when another market factor hits.  When GME makes a statement, when market conditions change, something.  We saw a downward trend as folks were paper handed out of this stock.  We saw an uptick when it hit the bottom and folks had some hope of a squeeze.  I predict nothing big will change in the next few days unless there is a significant change in information.  But nothing will happen if we don't hold, that's the only thing for sure.

You guys are all debating about GME as if it is going to be a binary event, believing it will either squeeze to infinite and beyond or go to zero. The reality is no one knows what will really happen, but things don't usually play out on the extreme ends of the spectrum in the real world. Usually, the real outcome lies somewhere in between.

That being said, I want you all to consider the case study of Tesla. Tesla was one of the most shorted stonks ever, but the shareholders of Tesla were resolute with their belief in the company, absolutely refusing to sell. This caused the endless feedback loop of old shots getting squeezed out and being replaced with new shorts. Over time, Tesla has undergone the fabled infinite squeeze over time by slow burning shorts.

The conditions are in place for Game Stop to do the same and it's rise will be accelerated by the low float, and keeping the float locked up as much as possible. Like the stock, hold the stock, and we will achieve the infinite squeeze over time. You must believe in the turnaround story and trust the management. Remain resolute and absolutely do not sell those shares. If you're just in this for a quick buck, then I suggest you reconsider at this point. To be frank, it's not looking promising. The system is against you. It could theoretically happen, but it's much more likely that it won't.

TL;DR - HOLD and if you're just in it for the dream of quick gains, please gtfo so your shares can go to someone else that likes the stonk and will diamond hands it so we can make GME go brrrrrrrr faster.

Because you just participated in what can only be described as a cultural phenomenon that turned into a massive rally against hedge funds you might have forgotten, or even never knew some things.

Everybody here is retarded, so it's retarded to use it as a kickstart platform for a social movement.

Everybody is also here to make money.

So let's talk about making some money. The entire reason GME became a target to make money on this sub had jack shit to do with a short squeeze. Initially, it was because some speculation after changes in the board. The fundamentals were not as bad as the company was priced, and it had a future.

Now the price has blown out the fundamentals, so think about the future of the company. At it's current trading price it's worth about 6 billion. Is Gamestop potentially a 20 billion company? If so, you will see retracement. If so, how long will that take? Years. Is that okay with you? I can't answer that for you, but what I can say is remember this was not initially about a short squeeze. If you still believe in the original thesis, a decrease in price means average down. If you own 10 shares @ 350, getting 100 shares again at 30 reduces your cost basis to 54, and if you think it's an $100 stock, you profitted.

The exact same thing is true for BB, and AMC. If you bought any of these for an actual reason, fix your cost basis now for the actual reason, and hold. DFV didn't get here by following a hype train, he made a solid thesis and held. Emoji's are nice and everything but take responsibility for yourselves and treat these like actual positions and fix your numbers.

Also avoid the options of these stocks if you don't understand what IV is.

They *still* have to buy the GME stocks as soon as they cover these short positions. The GME market (GME:NYSE) reacts heavy to little buy volume. Volatility doesn't work only for one side.

Yesterday I posted a DD on Tilray and why it was headed to the moon. Link below.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lail27/tlry_dd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

I’m returning today to inform everyone about how the $TLRY and $APHA merger happening Q2 will work. 

Based on the terms of the merger, $APHA owners will receive 83% of their $APHA shares as $TLRY stock. For all you smooth brains, this means that $APHA should be 83% of whatever $TLRY stock price is on a given day. This is currently not the case.

I have predicted that $TLRY will moon based on short interest and other DD. Link above. This means that $APHA is discounted and will follow this move. So smart money will buy $APHA to take advantage of this discount along with the impending moon of $TLRY.

Hope this helps. Don’t miss out. I have linked a screenshot of shorts in $TLRY below."

1612296953.0,0,Elon Musk trying to distract retail from Silver with recent tweets - $TSLA $SLV connection,"The gist: Elon Musk is trying to distract potential silver buyers with his recent tweets.  More details below, based on 3 observations.

**Disclaimer: This is my DD, hence the flair.  Please do your own research. Disclosures below. This is not financial advice.**

Three observations:

1)	Elon Musk is increasingly praising a specific financial instrument on his twitter

2)	Musk needs a serious amount of silver for several of his holdings: SolarCity (owned by Tesla), SpaceX, and Tesla

3)	Musk has a history of sending out tweets that wind up changing prices of assets


Breakdown:

1) Elon Musk is hyping something on Twitter, talking about how it is on the verge of being accepted. If money goes into that thing because people anticipate a spike in value, it can't go into buying up silver metals.

Source (Elon Musk's Twitter):

2) Musk needs silver metal for many reasons: solar panels for SolarCity (owned by Tesla), solar panels for Space X satellites, electrical conductors for EVs (Tesla).  Musk wants the price of silver to stay as low as possible, since his companies will need to buy it for industrial purposes regardless. 

Sources:

SolarCity:

https://www.streetwisejournal.com/5-reasons-silver-is-gaining-in-value/  

https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/solar-driven-silver-demand-set-to-dim-as-sector-innovates-60533352

<- States that Solarcity (and others) are seeking to move from Silver to Copper, which is cheaper, but has not done yet.  Most photovoltaic cells still need silver to be built, though this may change by 2028.

SpaceX: All these satellites have 1 solar panel, and likely use silver for internal electrical components + electrical shielding.

Tesla:
https://goldsilver.com/blog/why-elon-musk-secretly-loves-silver/#:~:text=Electric%20cars%20and%20trucks%20require,management%20system%20all%20require%20silver. <-- Claiming EVs use more silver than combustion cars.

https://banyanhill.com/silver-rally-tesla-cybertruck/ <-- Same as above.

https://www.kitco.com/news/2021-01-13/The-surprising-driver-of-future-silver-demand.html <Same as above.

**So what?**
If the price of silver skyrockets, so does the cost of manufacturing solar panels (for Earth and Space) and EVs, all of which eats into $TSLA's margins, as it owns SolarCity and uses silver for electrical components (also SpaceX's). 

So Musk, in my opinion, is understandably trying to get as many impressionable retail traders over to another safe haven ASAP **so that they DON’T go into silver.**  And that's why he's pressing it so hard.
  

And I love the guy, but he does have a history of tweeting things and then prices swinging around them (#TSLA420YOLO). Silver has a lot of strong pressures to buy right now, short and long term, and **Musk knows this**, and he would prefer to avoid a major spike if possible, since his companies will need to buy silver no matter what: you can't just sub in another metal right away.


**TL;DR**: If silver goes through the roof, solar panels, satellites (panels + internal components), and  EVs become more expensive to make, all bad news for $TSLA.  Theorizing Musk is pushing another safe haven on his twitter as a distraction, hoping to divert retail funds and thus dodging a silver price retail surge from hell. 


Disclosures: I am long and currently hold positions in $PSLV, $AG, and silver mining company ETFs, $TSLA via ARKK, and 4 silver dollars my great uncle gave me when I was a kid. I also hold a small position in what Elon's pushing.

1612296856.0,0,CORSAIR TO THE MOON?!🚀🚀🚀,"So my last post simply talked about my play on Corsair and there seemed to be a lot of disagreement so here's my actual DD behind it. Also before we get into this, for all the Logitech nerds on my last post, nobody cares that your mom bought you a $10 Logitech keyboard and you like the noises it makes, it doesn't change the fact that Corsair have better quality products for pretty much everything besides mice(my opinion).

&#x200B;

Ok so first things first, we all know that the gaming industry as a whole had boomed due to COVID and has had an increasing TAM for quite some time now and is projected to continue its growth. For that reason alone I'm bullish on a lot of gaming companies other than a few that I believe have way too high of a valuation.

&#x200B;

Lets start with marketing. If any of you have as poor of a social life as I since COVID started then you'd know that Corsair has been very active in social media marketing/sponsorships on Twitch. It feels like I keep seeing more and more streamers show sponsor slides of Corsair gear. This is amazing because in my personal opinion, I believe Twitch and YouTube sponsorships is easily one of the best ways to promote your products(referring to gaming products only). Just look at recent games that have all blown up, Fortnite, Apex Legends, Warzone, and Rust have all blown up due to their large presence on Twitch. Apex Legends and Rust quite literally paid streamers to play the game and look at how well that worked out for them.

&#x200B;

Next up we'll take a look at financials, don't worry I'm not going to sit here and tell you to do your full in depth fundamental analysis reasoning report but I do think we should at least pay attention to it. Even before COVID and still during COVID Corsair has increased revenues, net income, and cash flow. This just adds extra proof that its not like Corsair was a failing company before they got the boost from COVID. Another major positive would be that Corsair has increased focus around R&D which has only proven to significantly help tech companies move ahead of their competitors and acquire more market share. Just a couple companies that also focused R&D would be Tesla(all praise father Elon) and AMD. There's obviously more to the financial aspect however I'd rather not sit here and type out their entire 10-K in a reddit post.

&#x200B;

Lastly, I think with all DD you must point out the negatives as you go along. As I stated before, Logitech definitely beats Corsair when it comes to mice. However, I typed this entire post without using a mouse so who really cares about mice. Secondly, Corsair's CEO is Andy Paul. How can you put a billion dollar company in the hands of a man with two first names and to be honest, I don't know how they do it. Although that is definitely a big negative, their logo is extremely cool which I think makes up for it.

&#x200B;

Thank you for your time, now lets preheat this oven and start baking some tendies!

&#x200B;

Note: Logitech fanboys please don't attack me in the comments, I don't care about your mice, just leave me alone and go play pong or something with your amazing mouse."

1612296778.0,116,Some more DD for your BB (part 2),"Good 'whatever time of day it is for you' Autists,

As a follow-up to my post yesterday about BB, I wanted to attempt to place some of your worries at ease as many of you may be having second thoughts about your investments.  A link to my post yesterday will be provided at the end.

Yes, BB is dipping . However, please keep in mind that it is not dipping as hard as GME or AMC. There are reasons for this. BB had growth potential based on recent changes and it was never meant to be part of the current madness because the short interest just wasn't there compared to others.

It is apparent that of the BANG gang, AMC and GME got more media coverage than the rest despite having \*relatively\* less news than BB.  Referring to the premise of my DD yesterday, BB is a value play and NOT a get rich quick or anything play of the sort. This is a company that is reinventing their place in the corporate world, moving from phones to software development.  My smooth brain is holding on, even if it goes back to $7 because I believe in this company to reach new highs within the next year. 

If you invested yesterday after reading about how great I said BB is, I am sorry you can't buy a new Rolex today and you will need to go to Popeyes for your chicken tendies. However, that post was not meant to imply you would be posting gains porn by the end of the week. 

What we are seeing is likely a combination of paper hands getting scared of the pullback, and a correction in the stock after an unsustainable momentous gain based on the present value of the company. As they grow into their new position and make more and more deals to get their technology in everything, the stock will likely raise with it. When will this happen? Impossible to say, but the future looks bright. 

Before the recent momentum, BB was trading around $7.43. Even after the last few red days, BB is still holding over $11.50. Sure, this isn't as great as >$25, but like other stocks that go parabolic, there is an inevitable pull back. 

TL;DR - Stop being mad at your BB losses. Paper hands are for the weak. 

(Not financial advice, I am just a regular dude)

1612295862.0,644,Just a reminder: the current price of $GME is still higher than 1 week ago!,"My fellow autists,

the war is not over! This is a war, which wasn't started by us. The fuckin hedgies started it and the list of their dirty, cheap illegal attacks is endless.

Just a reminder: today's price is still higher than exactly 1 week ago. I am still more than convinced that the squeeze is going to happen, but there is only one simple thing, which we have to do:

# HOLD

and/or

# BUY MORE

This is very important! The price drop does not reflect an actual drop in the value of the stock. We should not be tricked into selling.

Whatever happens, the hedgies know that they ARE FUCKED! So today's attack was probably one of the most desperate attacks in history and it will enter the history books as the biggest coordinated activity. But there is something bigger that is going to enter the history books and this is OUR STRENGTH AND OUR ROAD TO VICTORY!! They involved us in a war and now we have to win it.

APES! TOGETHER! STRONG!

EDIT: I just realised: they're trying to scare us with loosing money. This is WSB, brothers. We lose money for breakfast.

EDIT 2: no financial advice. Buying and holding is just my opinion. But that the hedgies are trying dirty tactics against us is not an opinion, it‘s a fact."

1612295721.0,49,Massive inflation in the works?,"*  multi-trillion dollar covid bills being tossed out like candy from a 4th of july float
*  tax time coming up where the IRS would normally be bringing in a huge amount of revenue for the federal government, but a lot of businesses and individuals will be writing 0 in the profit column
* State and local govt's will need bailouts due their own tax shortfalls come march/april

It all seems like the $ going out is going to vastly outpace the $ going in, and the only way to make up the shortfall is to run those printing presses leading to run away inflation.

With that in mind, what are some ways to profit or at least not have money worth dirt? Would GME or AMC likely go up in this situation?"

Now I watch you all sit around with your 'almost' money and watch it materialize into just some regular run of the mill gains. Now we get all the ""coulda been's"" who are still sitting around holding on for their lives. The big boys who sacked up and showed/talked about some of their losses. What a sight to behold. ROPE is one of the trending tickers on WSB right now again. This is the WSB we've come to love time and time again.

 A friendly reminder it's just life changing money, it'll come and go from time to time. If you really believe in GME's future you shouldn't cry unless they are tears of happiness.

Welcome to wallstreetbets ya filthy degenerates"
1612295545.0,320,"Finally, some good news!","As we all know, the short ladder attacks have been consistent since last week.

The Hedge funds don't want us to win.

But today I discovered something whilst my wife was fucking her boyfriend,

If you look here on [NYSE website](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse-arca/notices)

click the 'short sale restriction list' you will see a bunch of spreadsheets with stocks including GME.

Because I have a brain as smooth as an F1 car, this means that as of the 3rd of February 2021 (tomorrow),  **~~GME will no longer be under the threat of a short ladder attack~~****.**

EDIT-         **Shorts will have to close positions tomorrow.**

A direct link to the spreadsheet which includes GME is linked [here](ftp://ftp.nyxdata.com/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers_2021/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers_202102/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers20210201.xls)

**But why?**

**There is a naughty list for stocks that have been fucked due to shorts**

Directly quoting [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/thresholdlist.asp),

A threshold list, also known as a Regulation SHO Threshold Security List, is a list of securities whose transactions failed to clear during the previous trading days. Threshold lists are published in accordance with regulations set out by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Regulators review this information as part of their efforts to detect **market manipulation**.

* A threshold list is a list of securities that failed to settle in the previous five trading days.
* They are published by various exchanges in accordance with SEC regulations.
* These settlement failures may be indicative of naked short selling, although they may also be caused by benign factors, such as administrative errors.""

Also, if you read on the official [SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#:~:text=Rule%20204%20%E2%80%93%20Close%2Dout%20Requirement,of%20like%20kind%20and%20quantity), 

"" 

* *Rule 204 – Close-out Requirement*. Rule 204 requires brokers and dealers that are participants of a registered clearing agency[\[8\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn8) to take action to close out failure to deliver positions. Closing out requires the broker or dealer to purchase or borrow securities of like kind and quantity. The participant must close out a failure to deliver for a short sale transaction by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+4. If a participant has a failure to deliver that the participant can demonstrate on its books and records resulted from a long sale, or that is attributable to bona fide market making activities, the participant must close out the failure to deliver by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the third consecutive settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+6. If the position is not closed out, the broker or dealer and any broker or dealer for which it clears transactions (for example, an introducing broker)[\[9\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn9) may not effect further short sales in that security without borrowing or entering into a bona fide agreement to borrow the security (known as the “pre-borrowing” requirement) until the broker or dealer purchases shares to close out the position and the purchase clears and settles. In addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out failures to deliver in securities with large and persistent failures to deliver, referred to as “threshold securities,” if the failures to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days.[\[10\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn10) Threshold securities are equity securities[\[11\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn11) that have an aggregate fail to deliver position for five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency (e.g., National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC)); totaling 10,000 shares or more; and equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer's total shares outstanding. As provided in Rule 203 of Regulation SHO, threshold securities are included on a list disseminated by a self-regulatory organization (“SRO”). Although as a result of compliance with Rule 204, generally a participant’s fail to deliver positions will not remain for 13 consecutive settlement days, if, for whatever reason, a participant of a registered clearing agency has a fail to deliver position at a registered clearing agency in a threshold security for 13 consecutive settlement days, the requirement to close-out such position under Rule 203(b)(3) remains in effect. ""

So buckle up my fellow autists, the ride is only beginning.

He is a avid WSB user, and a degenerate like us. Last week we where talking about this crazy gamble to squeeze GME before it went crazy. We both had positions, we where all in. Nonetheless, today he says he's done. He claims some of us are too greedy, and some of us are too scared of loss for this to happen, and for that reason, the institutional investors have won, they just need to bide for time while they bleed us dry. He's loaded up on $50 puts and claims he will be on the side that cant lose.

Most egregious, he said ""WE CANT OUTRETARD FINANCIAL INSTITUTION."" I draw the line here.
