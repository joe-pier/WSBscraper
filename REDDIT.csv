1612334880.0,20,$GME is a value play,"First I confess that i am as retarded as anyone else and you can guess from my very low Kama.But i understand accounting perfectly with a lot of badges in the subject.. One important measure of a company's balance sheet is its brand. You cannot put the value of a brand on its balance sheet unless it is purchased. Companies spend $b every year trying to shore up their brand. E.g  Doordarsh, ABnB spent a significant sum on advertising to get their brands up there for them to be valued at several times $GME even though they do not have as much tangible assets as ""GME. $GME's brand is now worth several x earnings but this will not show on the balance sheet.

WSB did not only contribute to the rise of the share price of $GME, but today the brand is def worth 10x what it was as at 12/31/20. If WSB also become loyal customers, and movies are made about this war, then the only thing stopping $GME from becoming $3k per share is the level of visioning by management. They can raise enormous amount of capital to become a serious tech company altogether. 

This is not financial advice. This is a personal opinion. Do not make decisions based on this.

TLDR: if you hold for even a year, $GME will definitely be valued at 10x today's share price if the present value of its brand is factored in."

1612334705.0,35,A short story that will inspire you to HOLD during these trying times.,"“Holding with my diamond hands! 💎 🙌🏽” he typed with trembling hands on his greasy keyboard. His girlfriend was deeply asleep next to him. She had come home late again last night after hanging out with Jake, the guy she jokingly called her boyfriend.

When GME goes to the moon and I get my tendies, she’s going to love me again!

His phone vibrated loudly on the nightstand next to him.
“I’m outside,” the text preview said. Fuck!

His brother, Charles, was outside. He had completely forgotten about the family brunch - a long-standing tradition that was usually a monthly occurrence. The pandemic had pushed their brunch plans and it had now been six months since their last reunion.

He clumsily climbed out of bed. He found his jeans from last night on the floor and jumped into them. They were the only jeans that still fit him. The lightly colored denim was starting to fade. He picked a black tee shirt that was loose enough to hide his pandemic gut. It had deodorant stains, so he knew his arms would be glued his sides all day.

He watered his thinning hair. He sprinted back into the bedroom.

“Bye, baby! I’ll see you after my family brunch.""
He leaned in to kiss her cheek but she, annoyed, dug her head deeper into the pillow so that she could keep sleeping.
He gulped at the purple bruise with teeth marks on the side of her neck.

The black Model S was sparkling in the sun. Their father bought it for Charles as a reward for getting accepted into the same neurosurgery fellowship their father trained at.
“That’s what you’re wearing?” Charles laughed.
“Ha ha yeah my other clothes are in the wash.”

His brothers biceps were bulging through the expensive shirt he was wearing. A water bottle condensed onto the cup holders. Charles was the family prodigy and exuded confidence in every step.

The drive to their parents house consisted of shallow catch-up small talk. He kept his hands on his laps the entire time in order to hide the Dorito stains on them.

                          -----   

“What the fuck do you mean you’re out of money, Dale?!” His father bellowed.
Images of $5,000 of expired PLTR YOLO calls came to mind.
If I had picked the expiration date for two weeks later, I’d be rich right now...
The other $5,000 his father gave him went into GameStop stock. He bought at the top, which was $350 dollars per share. It was now sitting at $80 per share.

They said I’d make tendies! They said it was free fucking money. There’s no way it could’ve gone tits up. Diamond hands prevai-

“Did you spend it all on the fucking stock market again?”
There’s no way out. I’m fucked. I don’t have any money. I need to tell him.

“Yes.”
“WHAT THE FUCK! You fucking degenerate!”
Charles was snickering next to him with his cell phone aimed at Dale. He was recording him. Susan, their sister, was blushing and looking at her phone. Their mother was embarrassed and looked worried.

Don’t give Charles a satisfying reaction. Stay cool. Diamond hands, baby.

""Dad. It's different this time! The shorts are ladder trading right now which is artificially bringing the price down. Plus, the short squeeze is coming any day now!""

He had no idea what ladder trading was. A user named u/PM_Me_Vagina_pics wrote that in a thread he saw earlier. Dale didn't even understand what a short squeeze was or how it worked. He barely grasped what puts and calls were and that's because Robinhood made it easy to do.

""You think you can beat billionaires at their own game?"" his dad hissed through clenched teeth. His jugular vein was bulging. Or was that his carotid vein?
I'll ask Charles later! He'll know.

""Yes! If we all hold on to our stock there is no way tha-""

“FUCK!”
His dad pounded his fists and left the table.

It wasn't even 11 AM and Dale had already ruined the day. Mother was mortified. Susan was scarlet. And Charles was chortling.

Most men would fold under the deep shame of being called a degenerate by their father. But Dale was not like most men. He took a bite of his blueberry waffles and pretended they were chicken tenders.
Yummy!

A small fire was alive inside of Dale. The spark of that flame came from a meme that made him giggle earlier. In the meme, there was a picture of a chimp. Or perhaps it was an ape? It was the caption, however, that captivated Dale and gave him the confidence to buy 500 more dollars worth of Gamestop stock. The caption read:

1612334397.0,42,Start of part deux of the GME short squeeze,"""**If  long shareholders see the tumbling stock as a new buying opportunity,  we may be at the start of part deux of the GME short squeeze.By Ihor Dusaniwsky**

**The momentum against GameStop picked up on  Tuesday morning as the short-squeeze rallies fueled by traders on  Reddit's** r/WallStreetBets **forum started to unwind. Shares of the retail  investor favorite were sent tumbling as hedge funds and Reddit traders  alike were left to wonder what’s to come for the volatile stock.**

**Yesterday, GME saw continued short covering,  but to a much smaller extent than it had experienced over the last few  days. With today’s stock price weakness, we should expect short covering  to be minimal, with the possibility that momentum shorts jump into the  trade. Stock borrow availability has increased so shorts are once again  able to add on to or initiate short positions.**

**And GME’s fall may not be over: What may  exacerbate its stock slide are long shareholders trimming their holdings  and realizing some of the unrealized gains they’ve earned as GME’s  stock price skyrocketed.**

**S3 data helps tell the whole story. Now, GME  short interest is $5.81 billion, with 26.09 million shares shorted.  Traditional SI % Float is down significantly from its highs in the  140’s% at the beginning of January. The SI % of Float is st 51.13% and  the S3 SI % of Float, which includes synthetic longs created by short  sales, is at 33.83%, telling us that there’s ample stock loan supply for  short sellers to access, should they want to short more shares. The  stock borrow fee on existing shorts is 19%, while the stock borrow fee  on new shorts is 10% to 20% fee.**

**Over the last week, the number of GME shares  shorted has decreased by -37.24 million shares, worth $8.4 billion, a  decrease of -59% as its stock price rose +193%. We saw just over 1  million shares covered yesterday. Shorts are down -$9.5 billion in  year-to-date mark-to-market losses, -278% for the year, and are up  +$3.08 billion in profits on today’s -52% price move ($107.00).**

**If long shareholders begin to sell their  positions, expect short sellers to jump in and help GME’s stock slide  continue. But if long shareholders see the tumbling stock as a new  buying opportunity, we may be at the start of part deux of the GME short  squeeze.**

People need to understand the GME saga is not united in its ideology. You need to adapt your expectations to that key fundamental fact. There are many factions of ""investors"" here. This was the case from the beginning, and has amplified as time went on and public exposure to the stock grew. People have their own agendas and plans, their own unique circumstances. This innate disunity is what is being used against you.  The billion dollar hedge funds know your lack of cohesion can be exploited, and that is exactly what they are doing. It is actually their only option. What else can they do? Admit defeat, close their doors forever and swallow untold tens of billions more in losses to cover their still numerous outstanding shorts? No, they are going to keep kicking the can down the road as long as they can, hoping to break your chokehold on them by exploiting your factions. They do this with lying, cheating, market manipulation and much more. But their main play to break the squeeze is the same: they need you to scatter and sell. Why did the VW squeeze of 2008 work so well? Because one single company (Porsche) bought up all the stock and one person was making all the decisions about holding and selling. In that case, the hedge funds were the ones caught off-guard,  scrambling in disarray to compete with each other and grab up all the shares they could. Right now, those same hedge funds are acting in collaboration and we, the retail investors are the ones in disarray. 

There are people who bought GME to make money. Everybody loves money right? That's probably why most people bought it. But there are also a lot of people who bought GME as a form of protest and revenge against the criminal class of Wall Street. There are people who love the company Gamestop and envision a brilliant future for it. Some people took personal offense to shorts coming in and trying to break down a store they like. Some people just really like the stock. Maybe people bought it for all of the above and much more.  No matter the reason, if you want to win, you will need to find common ground and learn to work together if you want to see the line go up and force those cornered hedge fund shorts to pay up. You have been given a golden opportunity to squeeze billions out of these Wall Street funds. It is very unlikely an event like this will happen again, at least not for a very long time. 

What I saw this morning was a predictable product of our innate disunity. Due to the viral exposure of WSB and the GME frenzy many new investors moved in last week in a very short amount of time. This created a ""hype"" bubble, which is actually fairly common in the stock market and happens all the time. This brought in all sorts of novice and first time stock owners, especially ones who don't understand basic stock market mechanics like price, volume, and order books. (Please people, learn that price does not mean much without VOLUME) They came in hoping to make a quick buck. They bought in at a higher price last week, saw the price per share tumble Friday, fell for all the fake news, rumors and distractions over the weekend because they don't understand that hedge funds lie for a business, saw the share price tumble today without understanding why, then panicked. They sold, dropping the price further, which panicked other investors of the same mindset, they sold, and so on until stop losses were triggered and caused more sales which panicked further people who sold and so on. This has been a strategy of the hedge funds since day one of taking money from the dumb retail market. It is just particularly effective when there is a bubble in stock price. This is actually an argument many people use as a justification of shorts, as they keep the entire market rational and prevent a bubble from ever forming so big that it has catastrophic economic consequences. But that is neither here nor there. But the point is people are confusing two separate events, this rapid bubble that formed last week and popped some steam off today, and the squeeze which has been a steady and gradual process. Remember, GME was $4 just 6 months ago. What was the low price today, with the stock price manipulation and panic selling here? Somewhere around $80?  Which is right about where the price was last week Monday just before it went absolutely viral. 

GME is still heavily overshorted. The Bloomberg terminal screenshot posted in another post here shows 90% as of today, 2/2/21. We are still in a squeeze. Yes, we had a temporary bubble and setback from our climb up, but no, this is not over by any stretch of the imagination. If you want to see the share price keep climbing then HOLD. If you want to see Wall Street bleed, choke on their arrogance and hubris, then HOLD. If you want to make Gamestop the funniest meme in all of stock market history, HOLD!!!! Feeding the hedge funds back shares at a lower price takes the pressure off them and lets them cover while mitigating their losses. Don't feed the hedge funds. We have the upperhand. We have the power and leverage. Only we can give it up and squander it away. They are the ones bleeding millions in interest. They are the ones with furious shareholders and wealth investors breathing down their necks. It costs us nothing but the own stress we give ourselves to hold. I agree we are up against a rigged system. We should all be calling and emailing our congress representatives to demand investigations into why so many brokers shut out new buyers but not sellers starting Thursday. We should be demanding investigations into institutional shorters who are manipulating the stock price purposefully by pingponging shares back and forth to each other with lower and lower prices supplemented with coordinated large dumps. We should be demanding investigations into what the financial relationships are, if any, between certain brokers who froze out buyers and these institutions with massive shorts on GME that we are betting against. We should be demanding adherence to SEC rules regarding transparent short positions. There is a lot to fix and change. So let's try to stay united on the things we can all agree on, like making the market fair for the little guy. Let's stay united in our vigilance against deceit and misinformation spread by these shorters. Let's stay united in our conviction to HOLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No amount of short ladder attacks, price manipulation, rumors, or fake news can scare us holders into selling. Why? Because we are ideologically united. The money will follow, if you hold.

1612332070.0,116,"Say it together with me, kiddos: I-N-V-E-S-T-I-N-G","Yes, this is a casino. Yes, the glories of WSB have been built on the charred corpses of untold retards who diamond-handed weeklies until the bitter end, and the few who climbed atop the fray to reach Valhalla. But there's an inconvenient reality that calls into question the mythology of WSB, which is that many of our most storied figures are, beyond the memes and rocket emojis, investors, rather than gamblers or their slightly more couth bretheren, traders.

If there's one thing that I hope the flock of newly-minted degenerates realizes, however recent events have shaken out, it's that there are multiple paths here and multiple ways to get rich and go broke or some horrific combination thereof. After GME or (insert stock here) comes and goes, there will be other plays that speak to your fancy. But the more you know about yourself and how you'd like to play this very elaborate game, the less likely you are to get fucked by it.

Hopping onto meme stocks is just one path. It's the most accessible and I'm all for it. Entire currencies have been created based solely on meme power. But the essential thing to know is that history does not repeat itself. There will never be another TSLA or another GME. When you invest in a meme, you aren't investing in something bound by history, or reason. Many of the stocks that become memes actually begin, like GME, as solid value propositions. By the time they become memes, though, you've already missed the ""value"" phase and you're basically banking on something that's hard to pin down.

It's a slippery basis for an investment, but it's made a lot of people rich. Maybe it will make you rich. This is one path that you can choose, but here's the thing, you actually have to be committed to it. Hopscotching from one meme to another won't get you to tendie town. That's trading, not investing, and trading doesn't work out well for most people.

The unique thing about GME - and many will disagree - is that it's a meme based on a trade rather than an investment. If you're an investor, a short squeeze is meaningless. Ryan Cohen can't sell at the peak. I think it's all gotten fantastically muddled. People have piled onto this play which is essentially a trade, but they aren't approaching it like traders. Again, trading is hard. If you're like me, then you suck at it and have had to swear it off after blowing up your portfolio twice on stupid options plays. Traders - the ones far more sophisticated than you and me - have actually been making a killing on GME.

I'd argue that the GME team does consist of investors, but they're investing in the wrong thing. At the end of the day, you can only invest in a company, and not a community of investors. Investing will never become a ""movement"" because movements are about values, while the market is about money. In this game, money always wins. You can attach a face to it - Melvin Capital, Citadel, whatever - but it is inherently faceless.

DFV didn't initially invest in a meme, or a movement - he invested in a (deep fucking) value proposition informed by his analysis of where Gamestop stood as a company and where it was heading. And then, as we all know, he held. And that's exactly what he has in common with WSB's other luminaries.

If you can see what the market doesn't yet see, put a chunk on the line that you can afford to lose, and *wait* (that's the important part) then you might have some juicy gain porn of your own to post in a year or two. You need conviction, though, or you'll just spend all your time looking at the tickers that made it big that day and move on to the next, sexier play. The only way to have conviction is to learn enough that you can actually internalize the DD that you come across and make it your own. And usually the only way to learn is to fail. Maybe that's the part of the road you're on right now, but it's a good start.

Edited for TL;DR - Know the difference between trading and investing, and try to do more of the latter. "

A lot of the new people here are probably aware someone named u/deepfuckingvalue make a fortune on GME but those who have been here longer have been watching this develop for a while. So now everyone is getting on the GME bandwagon because that’s how DFV made his money right? Yes, he did invest in GME but he did it by buying LEAPS. 

If you don’t know what LEAPS are they are options a year or more out. DFV bought low priced leaps and it paid off big time.  The thing is, in the last year, anyone could have basically invested in anything  and made a profit. 

The second thing he did was go big. Investing $100 isn’t going to change your life appreciably except in the most improbable circumstances. Risk what you can, but be willing to lose it all.

1612331028.0,102,Some questions about GME,"Alright retards I think there are some questions that need to be answered as far as GME goes. All that seems to become popular these past few days are diamond hand, 🦍 together strong means GME will go to the moon. 

Look I love the memes as much as the next autist, but it seems as this is the only content in the sub right now. That and the repetitive DD about short interest still being high, short ladder attacks, and lies in the media.

I know this is starting to sound negative, but I’m not a 🏳️‍🌈🐻 and believe in the OG GME DD, and am still holding my shares bought at $30, $140, and $240 levels, and I’m not fucking selling💎👐.

With that being said though I still have some questions about the future of GME and hope these questions might bring a bigger picture to rest of the sub. I’ll just list the questions below, looking forward to some answers.

1. What more can hedge funds do to drive down the price? We’ve seen the short latter attacks, lies in the media, bots in our own sub. These institutions aren’t going to back down and have the capital and capability to manipulate the market. So what else can we except going forward from these bastards?

2. Do retail investors have enough power against the hedge funds to come out on top? I’ve seen figures where retail own about 30% of GME, (please correct me if I’m wrong) but say that all 30% held is that enough to trigger the squeeze?

3. What is it like from the hedgies POV? They’re obviously trying to trigger selling to help their short position, but what exactly does their short position look like? I am not well-versed and short positions but know the basics. So they’ve borrowed shares that they eventually have buy back. What is the timeline on this? What is their penalty for delaying buying back the shares?

4. What exactly is happening with the brokerages and how much longer will this continue? Should have done more research on this, saw something about clearing houses, but can’t read too good. Why is RobinHood limiting orders? Is it due to hedge fund pressure or something else? Luckily I have been on TD and haven’t had problems, but majority of retail/WSB is on RH and these restrictions are hurting GME. What’s going to happen going forward with RH?

5. Realistically is the SEC going to do anything about the market manipulation, with either Hedge Funds or Brokerages? If so how will it help GME?

That’s all I got for now. I’ll update if I think of anything else. I apologize if these questions aren’t relevant, have already been answered or are just plain stupid. I am a truly a retard. 

Would love for other people to comment any questions they have as well, so we can get a bigger picture of GME going forward."

>We will establish and grow our U.S. presence through SweetWater's robust, profitable platform of craft brewing innovation, manufacturing, marketing and distribution expertise. At the same time, we will build brand awareness for our adult-use cannabis brands, Broken Coast, Good Supply, Riff and Solei, through our participation in the growing $29 billion craft brew market in the U.S. ahead of potential future state or federal cannabis legalization

**US Trademarks**

Aphria proactively filed US Trademarks for a number of their brands:

[Broken Coast](https://uspto.report/TM/90383411)

[Riff](https://uspto.report/TM/90383302)  

[Solei](https://uspto.report/TM/90383374)

Irwin is leveraging SweetWater's existing infrastructure to accelerate Aphria's entry into the U.S. ahead of federal legalization of cannabis to fuel sustainable profitable growth

I recently made a post in regards to [The Rolling 20’s - LEAPs on Cannabis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lab9sk/the_rolling_20s_leaps_on_cannabis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) where I highlight long term opportunities the marijuana industry presents with US legalization on the horizon. This is happeneing at an extreme rate & Aphria will be positioning itself as a top tier brand in the US through SweetWater.

**Broken Coast Brew** - *The best of the bud in the best of the brews*
>Inspired by the one and only Broken Coast, these small batch craft brews will have you saying “woah”. Packed with incredible earthy, dank and complex cannabis-inspired flavours you’ll feel the sea breeze in no-time. (Pg.25)

**RIFF** – *Loud without the cloud*
>Not for the un-inspired, RIFF’s brew masters bring the house down. Hoppy, flavorful and aromatic our lineup brings the party to wherever you are. Join us in this joint effort and run the show with these flavour-packed brews. (Pg.26)

**Solei Hard Seltzer** – *it is always sunny with Solei*
>There is no time to enjoy the sunshine like every time. Solei’s hard seltzers are created with the perfect combination of freshness and crisp flavours. Made with sun-kissed fruits, Solei Hard Seltzer brings the sun all year round. (Pg.27)

I wouldn’t be surprised to see the Solei concept featured on SweetWaters newly released [Premium Hard Seltzer](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210125005211/en/SweetWater-Releases-Oasis%C2%AE-Premium-Hard-Seltzer) at some point.

In addition to its traditional distribution footprint, SweetWater 420 Extra Pale Ale and IPA are served on all Delta flights nationwide plus internationally totaling more than 50 countries across six continents which has served to extend SweetWater's brand reach on both a national and international level. The Company also hosts an annual music festival, ""SweetWater 420 Fest,"" that has evolved into one of the largest and most anticipated music festivals in the U.S., increasing brand awareness nationwide.

This move creates a branded cannabis lifestyle Products Company with a diverse revenue base. I strongly encourage everyone to look into the management on both sides and come to your own conclusions. I also made a post about about the Aphria/Tilray merger, feel free to check it out:

##I fucked up today 

and it cost me $7k that I will most likely be realizing all or most tomorrow.  I set a long term PT on GME of $40-60 because I want to see a $10bn GameStop in the next year or so and instead I got excited and emotional and jumped in around the $129 mark this afternoon thinking ""tHe SqOzEnInG"".

[Here's](https://i.imgur.com/TtTEksS.jpg) my screw-up because I got emotional and didn't wait patiently to see if the ""upward"" trend this afternoon had firm footing. Spoiler alert: it did not. I was only up by about $2k when the floor fell out from under me.

I am EXTREMELY LUCKY because I've been trading all the way up and managed to sell quite a lot of $19dca shares at $380 and throw those profits into my savings account, but I left $25k (about 25% of my gains) in my investment account to ""play around"" with.

My CPA said not to, and I thought I could outsmart him. Ideally tomorrow won't be straight red, and I can escape with $17k or more (hopefully) but this should teach you that:

##SOMETIMES YOU MAKE A SHIT TRADE. 

That's why you're supposed to play with money that you can UNEMOTIONALLY LOSE. Seriously guys, it's giving me secondhand panic to see the guys who threw their savings in at $300 and watching the value sink very steadily down to $80 (and possibly less) and then they justify it with ""buuuuut it's to show the 1% how powerful I am!"" They're still billionaires and you're getting evicted. You really showed them.

##Going forward? I'll write this $7k against my gains and maybe toss the remaining $17k into the SPY or something boomerish while I wait to file my taxes next year OR I'll drop the position to 100 shares realizing about $3,000 in losses and sell weekly covered calls to *hopefully* chase the decreasing share price until I feel comfortable holding very long term or get assigned above my DCA.

1612330044.0,35,Future of Manufacturing: Desktop Metal (DM): short term and long term play,"Hello fellow autistic children. I know GME is still the hottest thing around. But, I am here to present a smart play, short and long term.

Desktop Metal (DM) DD

DM is a pure play manufacturing company that develops metal 3d printers. They are looking to replace metal casting and metal injection molding in the next 5 - 10 years. I believe that it could become a major player in the advanced manufacturing revolution and have 10x valuation.

The share price right now is around $25. I am expecting it to go to at least $30 in the very near future and this can easily go to $100 in 2-3 years.

Pros :

1. Stellar team: The team consist of professors from MIT, engineers from google,  Stratasys and the likes.

2. Clients: All major automotive OEMs such as General Motors, Ford, Nissan as well as Electronics manufacturers such as SBD are their client.

3. They just launched a new manufacturing system today. The new printer eliminated the solvent debind process which will decrease the cost and time of manufacturing.

4. Earnings are coming up on 11th Feb.

5. The average price target is around $26. The high is $30. The buy rating is around 70% with 0% sell rating.

6. It has a 25% short interest. There are around 15000 $25 calls expiring on 19th Feb. The short sellers are trying to keep the price of the stock below $25. Notice that today the price jumped on the news of the new printer but fell immediately afterwards.

7. Chamath did a PIPE investment in this.

8. It's 10th on the PRNT etf by Cathie Woods.

9. They just bought a dental 3d printing company which is a leader in their field. They have enough cash reserve to buy competitors and increase their revenue streams.

Cons :

1. The company is still pre revenue. Earliest revenue would be by 2022 probably.

2. Huge competition from players such as 3ds, Stratasys, Formlabs etc

(More cons are welcome)

My positions:

100 shares at $21.35

7 calls for $40 05/21,
9 calls for $35 05/21,
1 call for $20 05/21

Due to all the positive sentiment around, this should easily run upto atleast $30 before the earnings. It has already touched $28 last week. Also, for the Technical analysis geeks, this has formed a nice cup and handle shape and should be ready to rocket!

Buying May or further call should make 75-100% profit in the short term. Should hold shares for the long term.

PS: This is not an investment advice. I am a Mechanical Engineer and I love 3d printing and hence I have invested in this stock. Please do your personal DD.

1612329067.0,14,$SKT DD (Tanger Outlet Malls) *VALUE PLAY* please read 😌,"9th most shorted stock right now, great re-opening play to cope with new Covid environments. Tanger literally has open air malls that make it really unique in this new era of bricks and mortar retail.

Now, let’s look at the technicals. It currently has a 52% short float, which lags large squeezes like GME (121%) and SPCE (72%), but exceeds that of other performing names like AMC and BB.

I think $SKT is so compelling at a roughly $1.2B market cap. For comparison, its primary competitor $MAC has double the valuation, but does not have the same flexible retail space as Tanger.

If you look at GME’s short squeeze, they shot up right around $20 or ($1.2B market cap)!! 👀 Furthermore, Melvin and other big hedge funds are long on their $SKT shorts, and any surprise to the upside will send the stock absolutely flying.

Tanger has also reinstated their dividend. In a time where many bricks and mortar retail shops are desparate for cash, $SKT is out here with $700M of liquidity.

Companies with this much cash relative to their market cap are INTRINSICALLY UNDERVALUED. Even if this thing were to just double in market cap to just under $3B, that would leave a share price of roughly $32. The intrinsic value of the mall network is worth AT LEAST (in my mind) 5-7X where we are now at roughly $13 ($1.2B). 

These other names that I mentioned above have taken off given their market cap of $3-5B, and I FULLY EXPECT THAT RALLY TO CONTINUE. The short interest here is just too overwhelming for it to not push the stock flying at the slightest uptick.

But for the best value play, FACTORED WITH THE HEAVY SHORT FLOAT, I gotta go with $SKT. Holding 3200 shares at $17 and adding more as we go down. 18.7 days left for shorters to cover, so I think the squeeze is coming soon.

** Check out Tanger’s new CEO, Steven Yalof, if you are interested. He was a prominent leader at Simon Property Group, with the intent on expanding consumer base beyond retail stores. Let’s hope he get’s it right with $SKT. 🙏🏾

FEB 15 PT: $55

1612329046.0,96,Takeaways from GME - Where do we go from here?,"**The Free Market Isn't Free**

I have learned a lot in the last two weeks and I hope that some of you have as well. And I'm not talking about the fundamentals of investment, trading, or strategy. I'm talking about the mechanisms at play that tilt the market in favor of one group of people over another. Obviously this is an ever-evolving situation, but I think it's worthwhile to take the time to reflect on some of the key takeaways from the ordeal and start thinking about how we, both as a community and as individuals, can protect ourselves against falling prey to the same mistakes twice.

I'm not going to comment on whether there was intentional market manipulation on the part of hedge funds through all of this. It's immaterial to my thesis. What was exposed, first and foremost in my mind, is the uneven playing field that exists between institutional and retail investors. If possible, we should seek to find a way to negate those advantages and/or mirror them for the retail investor. I'll get into some ideas as to how this might be achieved later, but first let's dig into the advantages themselves.


**Advantages Afforded to the Institutional Investor**

*Access to Assets* 

One of the fundamental assumptions of the free market is that equal access to assets ought to be provided to those with means to purchase those assets. Hence, there is an expectation that brokerages act in all cases as a neutral party, an arbiter between a buyer and seller meeting on equal footing. The events of last Thursday show us this is not the case. Many, if not most brokerages, restricted access to an in-demand asset, leading to an artificial decrease in the value of that product as retail was allowed to sell freely, but not to buy freely. Again, this is not commentary on whether or not this was an intended effect, only an observation that it was the effect that occurred. In my opinion RH had so little liquidity available they would never have been able to handle the volume and were fucked either way.

Institutional investors do not rely on brokerages the same way a retail investor does, instead trading directly between one another. This creates a sub-market that exists direct-to-seller that retail investors couldn't dream of. As such, they have much more control over the actual trading they take part in. Moreover, insofar as the possibility of a restriction exists on those that fit a particular profile that cannot exist on those who fit another profile, it creates a situation that can warp supply and demand on a macro scale.

*Access to Information*

This one is quite a bit simpler. Institutional investors have access to algorithms that can predict and execute on market moves, up-to-the-millisecond data on market-wide trends, in some cases even access to trends in buy and sell limits that can inform how best to execute their next big move. In short, while the data accessible to the retail investor is improving at a rapid rate, it pales in comparison to that available to the institutional investor.

*Access to Capital*

The impact of the disparity in access to capital manifests itself primarily in three ways:

First, the sheer amount of capital that these institutional investors can draw from affords them the ability to single-handedly impact the market for a stock. This is why GME went down into the low single digits to begin with (along with the help of what were almost definitely buck naked shorts, which are illegal as fuck). This ability to move the market is an even greater advantage when you consider the ramifications of the fact that what the people of this subreddit have been attempting in trying to execute the People's Short Squeeze™ is essentially the same thing. So in that sense we're on an even playing field, right? Wrong. In order for our side to achieve the desired effect, we have to have a level of solidarity and commitment to the plan that in most cases is completely unachievable. As soon as a critical mass of diamond hands become paper hands, the whole thing falls apart. Now imagine what would have happened if Melvin weren't a single source of capital and instead a collection of millions of individuals each with their own free will. Realistically, half of them would have paper-handed out long before they shorted 140% of the free float of GME and this whole situation would never have gotten to this point.

Second, access to capital is only increased when you consider the willingness of others with just as much capital to bail institutional investors out when their position is all but dead. This is how you end up with the onholy trinity that is Citron/Citadel/Melvin all playing the same short position on the bet that there can't possibly enough capital on the receiving end of their play to make them lose. There is nothing even close to this kind of networking available to the retail investor.

Finally, access to capital renders regulatory fines effectively meaningless. If institutional investors can break the law in order to save their firm billions and it only costs them a few million, you'd better believe they'll do it every time. Their business is built on maximizing profit at all costs. Whatever moral compass they possess is a tertiary priority. Meanwhile if you or I get caught talking nonsense on a yahoo message-board, there's a very real possibility we go to jail.

**Mitigating Disparities of Access**

So, the game is rigged. We've always known that. But the average joe among us is finally getting a glimpse into just how that's achieved and that has the potential to empower us in ways that we've never before been empowered. If you don't know how you're getting fucked, you'll never see the dildo coming but if you know what to expect you can chop it off at the balls before it makes its way inside you... that's what my dad always told my anyways.

*Anything from this point forward are just my ideas about how we might address these disparities, but the key here is that we start having the discussions. If every idea I pose gets torn down because it's retarded (and I'm sure that they all are) I'll still consider it a win if it starts a discussion about how we as a collective can work our way out from under the might of this behemoth.*

I think it's time we start to completely re-imagine the way that small money invests and that we'd be best served by creating our own secondary market for securities that exists in parallel to, and completely independent from, the existing stock exchanges of the world. This secondary market should be entirely free of the influence of big money and serve as a platform for the transparent and honest trading of securities.

So how do we achieve these goals? Here's a list of guiding principles I've come up with:

- This marketplace should be open at all times, without closures or halts to the sale of any security.
- Member traders have access to all their assets at all times. 
- To ensure this, no person or collective should have access to assets on the exchange in the way a brokerage would; the exchange should exist as an infrastructure for the holding of assets in or movement of assets into, out of, and between one another. 
- Such a marketplace should seek to be as transparent as possible in every aspect, and allow for built-in avenues for both direct and community-wide communication between its member traders.
- To prevent the manipulation of this exchange, limits should exist for maximum allowable account size and maximum allowable assets to be transferred INTO but not out of an account. This allows an individual to make a hypothetically infinite amount of money, while disallowing the ability for any single actor to exert undue influence over the market.
- No liquidity should be required by the exchange itself. To achieve this end, trading should occur directly between individuals and no trading on margin should be allowed
- All accounts should be linked to existing brokerage/bank account(s) belonging to one person and validated against gov-issued ID. This prevents bad-faith actors from attempting to exert undue influence on the market by opening multiple accounts.
- All members’ profiles display a history of all trades completed by individual, but not current positions or transfers of assets in or out. This allows for a full log of market trends available to all traders without providing an excess of information that might give other individuals an advantage in trading.
- Stocks only; no short positions. Don't get me wrong, shorts have a purpose but the concept of borrowing shares and re-selling them later is antithetical to the idea of each account having in it only whatever assets that individual currently owns.
- All Intra-Market trades and trends should be visible to all member traders.

I hope you've enjoyed the musings of a hopeless retard. My ideas are probably garbage but they're garbage born of a desire to find a better way. Even if I haven't done that myself, I hope that we can do it together. Apes together strong. Have a good night.

 [S3 partners intentionally changed how they calculate SI % interest to manipulate public perception of shorts closing their positions.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read_this_they_are_screwed_numbers_dont_lie/) 

Pretty much the reason why S3 partners is estimating 55% short interest is because they changed the formula. It would be equivalent to what we would call 122% SI before the change (other people's math, not my own).

&#x200B;

They changed the formula from 

`SI = (shorts/float)`
to
`SI = (shorts/(float+shorts))`

This formula guarantees SI to always be beneath 100. 

Pretty much, 

0% is still 0%

50% is the new 100%

It doesn't scale up exactly linearly.

Do your DD, this is not financial advice, just thought I would bring this to light.

Be careful, do your research, not only is the game changing in front of us, but so are the standard measures.

I am not claiming the short squeeze is still happening or that it is likely happening. I would guess it's very likely they bought high priced puts which would make the amount we would have to go up SIGNIFICANTLY higher.

1612328168.0,142,Quick DD: Why S3 Partners' Short interest data is either BS or it is saying shorts doubled down,"Courtesy to u/smohyee for inspiration and picture

https://preview.redd.it/e4nurfxvy6f61.png?width=277&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8d3a8b26c810c7eb7d9e321b1fbab3fd19545fa

Last few days there has been this talk about shorts already covered, and S3 Partner's data showed a large decline in short interest. However, is this the full picture? We will be looking at this using Math. 

Context :[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448)

 """"it reduces the traditional SI % Float, Instead of Shares Shorted/Float our calc is Shares Shorted/ (Float + Shares Shorted) """"

Basically, the S3 short interest is calculated as

f(x) = x/(k+x)

where f(x) is S3's short interest, x is shares shorted, and k is float, which we can assume is a constant

For the Math savvy autists, you probably already see the problem. If you are not, open Desmos and graph the above function.

For k been positive and real, This function **asymptotically approaches 1** i.e. 100%. It should be pretty obvious - shares shorted + something positive is larger than shares shorted, so the fraction is smaller than 1. And, surprise surprise, data before 1/29 have short interest higher than 1!

**That means that either S3 partners is completely bullshiting their data, or the more likely case -  short interest displayed before 1/29 is traditional interest.**

Looking at this tweet [https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356392101806800897](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356392101806800897), we can see that the traditional SI on 2/1 is **78.16MM** shares on **51.03MM** float, which equates to....drum roll please...

***153%*** ***Short interest!***

So not only have the shorts not squeezed, they have doubled down. And this explains the price action much better - the price dipped down on a **Increased selling**.

1612328163.0,189,Possible HF strategy to shake out the 📄👐 before the 🚀🚀🚀🚀,"They know that at a certain level potential 📄👐 will no longer see the point in selling their shares. Who in their right mind would take massive losses and sell their shares when the price is, say, $5/share? Why not just hold and hope for a brighter day down the road? They have to keep the price above a reasonable level so that those shares wont be locked up.

Most of those 👨‍🚀🦍 who got in at <$30 are locked in on principal or are playing with the house's money. They aren't going to budge. The easiest people to shake will be those who bought in late. We are now below the $100 psychological level where paperhanded bitches will fold given enough time.

My guess is the play COULD be to seesaw from maybe $50 to $90 with occasional blips down into the 30s or lower to make it APPEAR as if the price is both settling and volatile enough to warrant a rapid descent. It could go on for days or weeks depending on what their books look like. That will scare a fuck ton of the bitches out of the game AND put the diamond handed retards in a position where they might actually consider selling.

So what's OUR play? As always: HOLD. This can only go on for so long. The shorts have to get covered. They are lying and manipulating to minimize losses but those who stay in the game will be rewarded IF we all call their bluff.

Even if this is completely off base, fuck them I'm holding. No more mister nice 🐒. The government bailed them out in 2008. Now they bail US out in 2021.

They are actually trying to do the same with silver because banks have a massive net short position, proof included.

[This shows](https://twitter.com/Laowai_Koala/status/1356603457424171015?s=20) the massive net short position that banks have in the silver futures market.  And if you want to look it up yourself you can [right here.](https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/BankParticipationReports/deajan21f)

Wait, banks are massively short silver in the futures market?  Yes

Your title bashed silver though? Yes, it’s the only way to post about silver right now. Forgive me WSB gods.

You want me to sell GME and go into silver? No. Hold your GME and go to the moon if that’s your play.  While GME is the current religious level obsession of WSB, there are people who are still interested in other plays. We’re not your enemy, WSB used to be a place where people could pitch all kinds of trades and bulls and bears made fun of each other but didn’t try to ban one another. 

There is a lot of disinformation going around that somehow silver is being pushed to help the hedge funds and banks recover losses from GME or something, but that directly conflicts with their massive net short interest in the silver futures market.

Further, silver has gapped down several times over the past year and there was never a peep from regulators.  Over the weekend all physical silver bullion from retailers completely sold out and Monday saw silver massively gap up. That night the CFTC raised margin requirements and today silver plunged. 

When it’s speculative longs buying silver and banks shorting silver, it’s the longs who were forced to sell today when margin requirements were raised.  Banks have essentially unlimited liquidity so a margin raise doesn’t affect them like it does speculators who are individuals.  

This is why for the short squeeze to work we need futures traders who won’t use their margin to max out long positions. Drastically cut back your leverage or don’t use it at all. Hold the cash you need to actually buy the silver at expiration, and then take physical delivery.  The shorts won’t be able to get enough silver to satisfy the contracts and will be left scrambling and silver prices absolutely soaring.

The silver short squeeze is an entirely different animal than GME, but it’s pretty obvious from the public data on net positioning by banks, and the immediate regulator action to the surge in price, that this is another case of retail vs corrupt wall st. banks.  

Silver surfers are fighting the same battle you are but in a different market and with bigger opponents. The trade appeals to a broader audience than just WSB though as there are doomer boomers who have been ranting and raving about this day for the last 2 decades who are also willing to dump their money into exposing the silver futures market for the fraud that it is."
1612327802.0,0,FISV WILL DOUBLE BEFORE EOY,"Been holding $135 leap calls since $92, playing weeklies for the short term trades, and it’s only gonna get better as it has for me. Here’s a little of my own DD.

There is So much to talk about. But, the First Data deal made Fiserv a powerhouse in payment processing and digital payments when they took over Clover. This market has three main pillars:
Point of sales (POS) terminals
Peer-to-peer (P2P) payments
E-commerce solutions
  Being a leader in any one of these categories should make Fiserv a $100 billion company. Its current value is $70 billion. But Fiserv is now the largest POS provider and P2P payment processor... And the company is going to use its expansive network to quickly build out its new omnichannel e-commerce solution.
A leader in all three of these categories has the potential to be well over a $300 billion company. FISV is partnered with Zelle, does more payments than PYPL’s Venmo and SQ  CashApp. PYPL has a market cap of 278 billion as of last Friday. If FISV can get to $100 billion it should put its PT at $150 and that’s very low ball. Their margins are going to continue to grow and if they just matched PYPL market cap, it would put them over $300 a share. There are several potential catalysts as far as buy backs, earnings, etc. 

As I mentioned above, Clover is bigger than Square, yet is only part of FISV business, and the two go after different markets. Clover (generally) works with bigger businesses. Over 90% of Clover customers process over $125,000 in payments annually. Only 65% of Square’s customers transact that much. Not trying to bash SQ, only showing that FISV has a lot of catching up to do as it is still trailing SQ market cap by 30 Billion. 

The difference between Zelle and PYPL’s Venmo and SQ (cash app) is that Zelle is backed by multiple large institutions like Chase, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank, and Capital One. The traditional financial institutions basically joined together to build a network so they wouldn’t be outdone by the likes of Venmo or Cash App. The advantage is that all of the financial institutions involved
in Zelle are marketing the P2P service to their customers and it’s only going to grow. Fintech will be one of the hottest sectors going forward and FISV will be the leader. No reason why FISV isn’t at least $150-200 by EOY. Earnings 2/9. Don’t miss this undervalued STRONG company."

1612327534.0,0,Post $GME and $AMC - Next Potential Short Squeeze Target ($TLRY),"For those of you still holding $GME and $AMC, Congratulations! Over the past week you've been bombarded with numerous challenges, from brokers restricting purchases, fake news, to stock dilution. It is always harder to hold a winning position than a losing one so my hats off to you sir if you are still holding.

With that being said, I'd like to talk to you about a next potential candidate for our short squeeze strategy. The company is Tilray ($TLRY). You've probably seen this symbol floating around in different posts but I'd like to talk to you specifically about the numbers and the timing of it.

If you've been living under a rock or on a tree (You ape) Tilray is a Canadian Cannabis company with its stock traded on the Nasdaq (Not a lot of legal Cannabis companies are traded on the regulated exchanges so this is a big thing). Aphria ($APHA) is in the process of acquiring Tilray and post-acquisition will become the largest Cannabis company in the world. The deal is expected to close sometime during the second quarter and $APHA will be taking over the Tilray name and the $TLRY symbol on the Nasdaq.

As per Yahoo Finance, the latest float is about 95 Million shares and even though the current shares sold short (From Jan 15, 2021) is 34.37 Million which is moderate, one should pay attention to the historical total shares sold short which from a month ago has grown more than 24%. This means there is something in play and I am also willing to bet based on current price action and historical trends, the next short interest release will go up as well.

&#x200B;

[Large Rise in Total Shares Sold Short](https://preview.redd.it/pemqywhf07f61.png?width=1358&format=png&auto=webp&s=813869b0195bc158c342de184f9a9dae2d3d598f)

Based on the amount of money involved there is probably one large or multiple large hedge funds playing this since they are the only ones sophisticated enough to sell shares short especially involving that much money. You can also look at the price action itself prior to Monday (When Good news got released) during different times of the day, there are always trades put in near the closing to make sure the prices don't exceed a certain price level which indicates true active manipulation by the bears. Retail traders are not sophisticated enough to do this thus indicating large hedge fund involvement.

There are a couple of factors that will help us with this conquest.

1. The Timing and News: Obviously, with this democratically controlled congress, legalization is a priority and has the highest chances of succeeding in this current political environment. As you have seen before (Do your own DD), any indication or news of progress of legalization has pushed this stock up. As of Monday, three senators; Chuck Schumer (NY), Cory Brooker (NJ), and Ron Wyden (OR) just promised to introduce marijuana legalization reform in the ""early part"" of the year. So there is a string of news and progress coming.
2. Way better fundamentals than $GME and $AMC: The poor fundamentals obviously bothered a lot of people who wanted to buy $GME and $AMC. But in comparison, if you dig into Tilray's financials, it is significantly better. Especially the cash balance. Mostly importantly, Tilray's product lines are diversified and they are currently still growing (this is a big thing for any business), especially in the international markets.
3. Its already primed: If you dig around Reddit, WSB, or even Stocktwits, you can see numerous people have already committed to baggage holding this stock. You are not too early and you won't be the only one to do so.
4. Harder for Management to Dilute the shares: As we saw previously, one of the challenges for the buyers of $GME and $AMC was battling against management's decision of stock dilution by the companies themselves. To put it in retard terms, diluting a stock is essentially printing more shares thus creating inflation in the stock so its harder to go up. Since Tilray is in the process of the acquisition by Aphria and it is an ALL STOCK deal via conversion ratio, it makes it harder for Tilray to implement dilution without significantly risking the deal.
5. Lightning can strike twice: A short-squeeze already happened in the past (2018) so you know the short-squeeze strategy already worked for this stock so it can work again. The brokers and exchanges are more prepared as their volatility risk models are already prepared to support significant high levels of volatility for this stock. Less chance for disruptions.
6. A means to an end: Lets be realistic, if you are holding $GME and $AMC right now, you will sell it. It could be tomorrow or it could be 3 years from now (If those companies are still in business) but you WILL sell it.  THAT is a very long time to hold baggage just to prove a point and you know the businesses you are holding suck from a business standpoint. Now since the Tilray and Aphia acquisition deal is on a timetable which will be completed sometime in the second quarter, that can be your exit time. You can go out gracefully if you choose to as you've already proven your point, made some money, and on the dawn of Tilray becoming a different company and under new management. For those of you choosing to keep those those shares post acquisition, how would you feel about holding shares to the largest Cannabis company in the world with good fundamentals, and on the dawn of full federal marijuana legalization? I would love it.
7. Great Symbolism: Lets face it, investing in a failing gaming company and movie theaters during a global pandemic doesn't really scream smart symbolic reform or via la revolution that well. But if you choose to focus on making a stand with a legal Cannabis company with a great future you can at the same time promote marijuana legalization and stick it to the hedge funds and dark capitalism at the same time. What better way to make a point to promote a great cause, symbiotic change, and at the same time make some money (If we are all on board).

Ok that's it! Kudos to you for making it to the end. Apologies for the long post but I really wanted to  get my points through. You all should obviously do your own due diligence and if you see what I see and the immense opportunity that is in front of us, and agree with my thoughts then lets do this!

BTW, if you are really retarded; I am NOT telling you to sell your $GME and $AMC. I'm only suggesting that we should start to look at other potential candidates for our short squeeze strategy to continue our cause of burning hedge funds and dark capitalism.

I just feel Tilray is such a great candidate for our cause and strategy especially with so much marijuana reform coming our way. We can make a greater point for a greater cause.

1612327206.0,1222,"GME urgent RE-EDUCATION - unify, clarify, focus and execute","How can I start this.. the paradigm that defines our role on GME needs urgent and drastic clarification  if we are to steer this thing back onto the road.Whether we want to admit it or not, we're fucking drifting atm. The hype is dying as all hypes do, the whole thing is glued with spit and running on pure randomness and doom inevitability (""we're all poor so we don't care, it's either moon or bankruptcy"").

TH THA THA TH, time out.

Listen up fucktards, I'm poor too, but that's not the point. We need to go over the whole situation with perspective, and this is not some detailed nerd shit so it'll go easy on your 2 braincells.  


Repeat after me: we are not gonna trigger the short squeeze. WE ARE NOT GONNA TRIGGER THE SHORTSQUEEZE.  
It's easy to fall into disbelief by misunderstanding our part in all of this. We are not triggering shit, so all the retards YELLING buy buy buy every time it starts to go up need to come back to reality. It's NOT our job to trigger the short squeeze nor would we be able to.  


Picture a roman colosseum (an old stadium you mongs). In the middle of the arena, down in the pit you have all the shorters doing their thing, having a jolly good time. There's several tunnels surrounding the pit and leading OUT to freedom. 

To get the short squeeze we need them right there in the pit, so that's done. They're already there, shorting GME to shit, not by 13% which was enough to rocket VW share price 5X back in 2008, but by a staggering 50% to 130% (numbers irrelevant, point is the ammo is more than enough). As you can see there's plenty of shorters in the pit, so they're confident and comfortable.

  
Now, for the shortsqueeze to work you need 2 things:

\- a boogeyman  
\- something blocking the goddamn exit  


The boogeyman is ANYTHING that makes them fear for their billions and run for the exit trampling each other on the way out. The less shares available for them to cover their shorts the smaller this boogeyman can be, because they will panic knowing they may not be able to cover at all, meaning THE END.   
It could be literally a thousand different things, and the longer we go into the future the more likely that something will HIT. Could be someone scooping up an extra slice of the company (Ryan Cohen for example), earnings blowing out, anything. And this company has received SO MUCH free advertising in the last few weeks it's not unreasonable to think that they are at a historic turning point (not gonna get into the reasons why it's already a great value investment), and it will soon show.  


THEN, we come.  
We, the group of INDIVIDUALS that happen to be investing in the same stock because we like it.

What are we? We are bodies.  
Pilling up.  
On the fucking exits.

The more shares you own the fatter you are, and the fatter you are the more space you take up on the exit. And my friend my friend, the hedgies are REALLY gonna need the exit when the boogeyman shows up.  


Our role here is to buy as many shares as we can in order to clog the exit doors, so that the shorters have no way out when a boogeyman comes.If something big drops and there's not enough unflinching share ownership (buyers that won't sell no matter what), then the shorts will just make their way out and fuck all will happen.

Sure, there must be a lot of individuals and institutions unwilling to sell to bail shorts if they need to cover, say most of the GME board for example and maybe a couple institutions, but likely not nearly enough.

That's our part. If say half the people on WSB buy an average of 5 shares, that would be nearly 20 million shares. That's nearly 1/3 of the total GME shares available.If say, over a month we are able to turn that average into 10 per person, half of WSB would own a staggering 60% of all the shares, and you may say oh well that's not possible BUT JUST THINK ABOUT IT, many among us have investments in the hundreds of thousands, some even millions. Each one of those can bring the average up a hell of a lot.Heck, even I with my 20 shares god bless them, can make up for 3 people on WSB that bought nothing.  


Time really is on our side, if we just keep gobbling up shares we can really block those exits for the shorts, and when the time comes they will panic because they will realise there simply aren't enough shares to cover - GME goes straight to the MOON.

We don't need to worry at all, there is no losing here because mathematically it's a time bomb.THIS WILL NOT SURVIVE ON HYPE.HYPE IS NOT OUR FRIEND.Understanding the situation and calmly and patiently executing is how we can succeed.  


We need to unify, clarify, focus and execute.  


&#x200B;

**TLDR -**

**The GME gang is losing its way because its all hype now. Hype will kill this because hype dies.We need to clarify our role and execute with patience. We don't trigger short squeezes, our function is to accumulate as many shares as possible so that when the time comes and something big and positive drops, the shorters try to cover but can't because we have all the stock (or most of it), they panic and GME moons.Basically the only thing that matters is to keep accumulating as many shares as you can, and to understand your role. This diamond hand shit is NOT needed because the price is irrelevant, it's the inevitable math of the short squeeze that matters and that's where the focus needs to be.**

Now to the main subject GME is still an undervalued treasure. I know it seems like it might be overvalued because of the euphoria around GME these past two weeks, and how the media (and even some folks on wsb) try to portray it as a bubble, which it isn't.

1. Its a company with around $6 billions in annual revenues, and a new set of innovative leaders (Cohen and friends) who have a track record of turning companies into money printers (Chewy Inc now worth over $44 billion, was first losing money and bringing less than $26 million in revenue).
2. Its growing its E-commerce side by a whooping 254% (25% of all revenue was form online sales last quarter).

3. The future is bright, those that can weather the storm will reap the fruits and tendies that GME and BB have to offer.

Although we are dipping down into the depths of hell, everyone was staying positive and trusted that the squeeze has not happened. This was not true when I sorted comments/posts to controversial though, as they were mostly negative.

1612326378.0,132,DO NOT BUY CALLS IN MARGIN ACCOUNT !!!,"It's obvious that stocks like GME and AMC are prime targets for short sellers who want to bring the price down.

Collusion between RH, prime brokers and the DTC can potentially damper the effects of the short squeeze because of loose and unsanctioned SEC rules regarding Regulation SHO that governs short selling, and in this case, [failures-to-deliver](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm).

If you have a margin account, brokerages do not need your permission to lend your exercisable shares if you buy a call or sell a put. This is their way of temporarily creating shares out of thin air, aka counterfit shares. While you wait for expiration date, brokerages keep a tab of all its customers' ""lendable shares"" and sends it to the DTC in this thing called the share borrowing program. The DTC will then lend those to other brokerages whos customers just bought a call option that is essentially a naked call initiated by the seller. Now while this call option remains open, since it's a naked short, the shares get to be lent again into another new naked short in a other brokerage, in **an ever-perpetuating cycle that results in a temporary increase of the number of total shares traded**.

This trick hedge fund use is called Continuous Net Settlement (CNS), and there are many other ways for shortsellers can manipulate the stock price, inclusing Ex-clearing and Fails-to-deliver strategies.

So if you buy a call or sell a put from a margin account, you're essentially allowing the number of total shares to grow artificially which makes the price go down!!!

Plus, these created shares cannot be accounted for, but in most cases, undiscoled short shares typically represent 20 to 50 times the number of failures-to-deliver (which is the only metric the SEC tracks).... that's HUGE!

So before the downvotes just rub those two brain cells of yours together for a minute to focus on this for the next three minutes. (Fuck you I know what I said)

Due to all of the paper handed bitches, hedge funds shorting, and just general fuckery at the hands of retail trading apps, particularly robinhood, NOK is currently on MASSIVE discount.  Why do I say that? Because the fine folks over at DNB markets, Norway’s leading investment bank, have raised its stock valuation to €4.80, or for those of us who speak freedom, $5.80.

Why does that matter? I hear you starting to ask. Well it matters because it’s currently trading at only $4.53. 

There is over a dollar of pure value just waiting to be claimed. Not to mention it is expecting a very strong earnings report that can cause that value to go up even more. O and the company had been vocal about wanting to start its dividend payments back up. This earnings report should put them on the map for a lot of people. I’m buying more tomorrow, see y’all in space.

This was NIO’s 6th consecutive month of sales growth, and they’ve now delivered 82,866 vehicles. They continue to outperform Xpeng and Li Auto, BUT are still trailing behind Papa Elon. So who gives a shit? *YOU should.* 💦😩

NIO is *only up 5%* over the past month, lagging and consolidating behind the broader market. Despite the fantastic delivery numbers AND the corresponding increase in EV market share, the share price DROPPED 2% today. Reminder that Pooh Bear J-Ping wants **25% of all new cars sold in the country to be electric by 2025**. NIO’s continual market share growth into *the* largest EV market in the world is literally an unmatched opportunity, with China’s EV sales [expected to top 1.8 MILLION THIS YEAR](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/upcoming-catalyst-could-move-chinese-213553234.html). It has almost completely retraced it’s price back to it’s pre-NIO Day levels, suggesting that it’s ready for a breakout. No, literally [go look at it’s chart right now.](https://imgur.com/a/dtPsHVb)

&#x200B;

In addition to deliveries, NIO is rumored to be looking to **expand into Europe** with it’s SUVs. *THIS MAY BE THE LAST ENTRY POINT BEFORE THE RUN-UP AFTER EUROPE EXPANSION PLANS* They’ve also recently released their first sedan model and are expanding their Battery as a Service infrastructure throughout China. It also goes without saying that having active backup from your authoritarian country is VERY helpful.

1612324294.0,41,Reasons why the Fed could not allow the squeeze to happen.,"I'll preface with saying there will be no rocket or diamond emojis in the post so if that is what you are here for you can stop reading now lol.

The fed is still fixing the damage done during Feb/Mar/April with things like Unlimited QE, overnight swap rates at just about 0%, adding of liquidity to the markets with the buying of not only bonds but securities...ect. They are just barely getting it propped up again on bullshit (my opinion they should have let the banks and large corps fail. but that has no relevance on this).

The Fed absolutely could not allow these Market makers to potentially be open to legitimate infinite losses to the point of insolvency.  If the squeeze actually did happen and literally forced one or two MM's / Clearing firms to go under. This would force a huge liquidity problem in the overall markets with Market Makers having to sell off their other existing positions which pretty much keep the market propped up at the moment. There are not many of these MM's so if even one failed it creates a huge systemic risk.

These companies are required to figure out worst cast scenarios like this. So if they are required to figure out the worst case the Fed also knows what the worst case is. 

It would be the literal un-doing of everything the fed has done up to this point. Do you see how many transactions companies like citadel clear? Who would step in to take the place of them if they went under?

Yes I'd absolutely love that to happen because we would get huge discounts on pretty much any value stock we wanted with the mass sell off like in Feb/Mar/Apil. But do you for one second think the fed would actually let that happen again if it could be prevented ahead of time.

Call me a tinfoil hat if you want because maybe this is a little far fetched but I wouldn't be surprised if the fed actually played an active roll in preventing the squeeze from happening by offering suggestions and advice to the companies involved in all of this. They saved the banks in 2008, they saved them again in 2020, why would they not save them this time.

I just don't see a way this would have ended well for the markets as a whole with everything that has been going on after the black swan that was corona. So how could they possibly allow that to happen."

It's been a rough couple of days for a lot of us who are involved in GME in one way or another. I'm used to seeing red after being involved in many trades that went sideways (down) since 2004 when I started trading.

The internet community was not as ... Versed back then. It was a little harder to get the information you needed.

That brings me full circle to where we are now.

Something doesn't sit right with me with this whole situation. Not just because my account is red with too many commas. But because I keep hearing that ""these"" people have these ""powerful computers"" that can do things we cannot do.

I don't believe that... I can't believe that. Because that goes against everything I know; it goes against everything we are as people, as humans, and 🐒. We never give up on the face of adversity, we strive to overcome it no matter how great and difficult... Because that is how we grow, that is how we make our lives and the lives around us better. This is how we make it so the world is a better place for the generations that come after.

So how can we mitigate these ""ladder attacks""? What can we do to defeat them? What can we do to use it against them?

I ask this... Because I know many of you out there are a lot smarter than me... A lot more creative... And a lot more knowledge able.

I want to think that this is the way. By collectively solving a problem. This is how we grow isn't it? That is how anyone grows. By reaching out and trying to be better than we were a minute ago.

u/PlatNoFeatures has done some great DD on the stock and that got me looking into it.

I am retarded. I did really good on the whole AMC and GME craze, got cocky, and fucked up everything on horrible calls with no research. Well I won’t do that again. Now I’ll fuck up money while doing lots of research so I have no excuse and feel even shittier.

I won’t go into the DD Plat already did, check this for that: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwo5p5/callaway/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwo5p5/callaway/)

Any way, as you can see from this fucking crayon drawing, now is a good time to buy ELY. The blue curvy line is not just a representation of my floppy dick, but also the 21 adaptive EMA moving average. Stonks love moving average and it’s about touching now so buy it might be gud idea. It might dip a little below I guess, the average is not a fucking time machine or a crystal ball.

Since December there has been support at around 22-23 dollars, and the resistance is obviously at 30 right now. High end price target is $40 with earnings coming up.

Now im new and obviously retarded so like...my crayon drawing probably doesnt mean shit but stonks supposedly love the average and we aren’t way above or below right now. I am highly considering selling everything i’m bag holding, which will come out to between 700-800 if I sold everything tomorrow no matter what lol and going in on calls.

That’s obviously not a big move for shares and I want to build the base up so calls it will most likely be. I have one 2/19 $31c right now at $1.39 premium. Probably go for 30’s if I “yolo” on this. I know it’s small money for now, fuck you im paying tuition.

One thing that is concerning is volume is low, but if wsb autists get on board, maybe we can do something.

Looking at RSI on the bottom and comparing to price vs average in the next pic, we see that it doesn’t appear to be overbought right now, further indication to try and get in around or slightly lower than today’s close

This is obviously not financial advice. Someone convince me to fuck off at 50% loss of initial investment on GME and AMC (including 2/19 calls for AMC) and go all in on this instead….you fuckers would love to see me blow up the account anyway.

EDIT: It's a fucking drive shack near me, not topgolf. Point stands, these types of venues pack the fuck out (even in pandemic)

1612323844.0,0,Amarin DD,"The company name is thought to mean everlasting or from the sea depending on who you believe. Both are quite right. Vascepa is icosapent ethyl... a purified and modified omega-3 that when taken on top of a statin (think Lipitor) basically cuts your risk of dying, having a heart attack, or a stroke by 25%. 
Sounds good right? Lipitor was the best selling drug of all time until Humira. Yet it started out slow in its first year just like Vascepa...and without a pandemic. Now we have generic statins with hundreds of millions of patients worldwide taking daily. Lipitor had its run though. Just ask Pfizer. And it still sells tons of cabbage. But there is only one Vascepa that reduces your triglycerides and reduces your cardiovascular risk. Funny thing is...it’s not the triglyceride reduction that bestows the benefit......more later......Less stokes, stents, open heart bypass surgery....and DEATH!!! 

There are many different oils, or properly called fatty acids, in those over the counter omega-3’s you may take. But only this particular one has been shown in double blind randomized trials to Work. At least two of the others, DHA and DPA likely actually hurt!!!!! No one really knows why. We think it’s it’s powerful anti-inflammatory properties of 100% icosapent ethyl or EPA (Vascepa). 
Think.....“it coats the insides of your arteries and puts out the fire connected to the ticking time bomb”. For reference see the New England Journal of Medicine article from 2018 called the REDUCIT study. Also see the EVAPORATE study from 2020 that showed coronary artery plaque regression. That’s right...Vascepa likely is liquid draino for your coronaries!!!! 

Let that sink in a minute. There are two large Covid-19 studies reporting in first half of this year called MITIGATe and PREPARE—IT. Prepare-It will likely read out end of Feb. Mitigate interim around May. The thought is the anti inflammatory power of V helps. One Canadian study presented in December at the national lipid association showed statistics better than Remdesivir. Vascepa may snuff out the cytokines storm that kills you from Covid!!!! 
It may also disrupt the viruses transmissibility as covid is wrapped in...you guessed it...fatty acids and lipids. 
Let that sink in a minute. 

Amarin won the FDA approval for CVT reduction in Dec 2019. She hit $26 soon after. March 30, 2020 a Nevada judge was hoodwinked into overturning the patents of the original label for treating only patients with triglycerides over 500 to treat pancreatitis, thus potentially allowing generics to entreat themselves to AMARIN’s three billion a year US market (when mature..we only a year in). More than 90% of Vascepa scripts are for the cardiovascular indication...not for the skinny label treatment of triglycerides...for pancreatitis. The money is in the CVT risk reduction...i.e...the statin patients world wide. AMARIN spent nearly a billion dollars bringing this indication to market. And now generics want to try and steal it all. So far so good except for the market perception. AMARIN claims to have the API sources secured. 

Thus far there is one generic made by HICKMA. The company that won the court case. Litigation is still ongoing and AMARIN is now suing them for infringing on the CVT indication patents that are still quite valid. Damages could be huge!!!! 

Amarin won EU recommendation for the CVT indication in Europe on Friday and can start marketing likely by April. Europe’s market is maybe 50% larger than the US. Thus far Amarin has maintained the US market with Hickma currently holding 6% of the market. Yet the stock cratered from $26 to $4 in March. Today she sits just over $8. The drop was likely because all thought the US market was completely toast. Clearly it is not 4 months post generic launch. Add to this that Lovaza still makes up a large part of the prescription omega-3 market and there really is no good reason to ever take Lovaza now that Vascepa is here, and you can see that AMRN’s revenues are going to be huge. Last year was unaudited $611 mill. 1 billion tax loss carry over. 550 million in cash or investments. No debt. Zero debt...... Price currently $8.25 

There seems to be a lot of selling between entities to ladder step her down almost daily since the March debacle. Despite that she has doubled. That the company updated its “Change of control” package and policy in an 8-k filed this Friday, one day after European approval recommendation could mean a Buy Out is imminent. Amarin was built for a buy out. She a one drug pony, but the drug is a doozy. I truly believe US can generate $1 bill in sales. EU $3 billion a year. Approval in China by Amarin partner could generate $5 bill a year but AMARIN gets a straight high teens royalty from Eddingpharm ( the Chinese owned partner) 

Long story short, this drug saves lives and WILL make a lot of money. Last I looked there were 22 mill shares short. With float of 386 million but much more than half the float is locked up. The daily shenanigans need to stop. The respect and eyes of the world needs to be on Vascepa!!!! It’s truly a lifesaver with untold uses and benefits. I honestly believe there is a huge covid benefit to being on Vascepa and we will soon know. Let’s see what happens when the PEOPLE get behind a company that has been screwed over and over yet gets back up again because the science of the drug is a once in 50 years proven scientific discovery. I bet she deservedly goes gangbusters and MOST IMPORTANTLY ....then HOLDS her gains. There won’t be a find a chair when the music stops here.

Liftoff"
1612323365.0,227,My favorite and least favorite part of all this,"

Thinking back from the past month there is one thing that has stood out and resonated with me more than anything else.

This is simply that the vast majority of people are generous when they come across a sudden inflow of cash. As soon as people here started making money, you guys started immediately paying it forward, which is absolutely incredible to see. **For this you should be incredibly proud of yourselves.** 

It is encouraging to see that people can maintain the capability to care about others when they come across money, this is the way it should be. 


My least favorite part is how the media tried to paint this place in a way that tricks the general population into thinking we’re the enemies, yet during all of this there has been nothing but helping each other out and ensuring that the wealth was spread in ways to those that weren’t able to participate or finding ways to help someone else. The media then praises Wall Street for cheating, stealing, and continuing their parasitic tendencies. It just goes to show you who is in control of the narrative; **Scared sociopathic wealthy people who know the majority are far better people than they’ll ever be so they try and compensate with their socio-economic status, when in reality, it just shows how sad and insecure you have always been.** 

Wall Street individuals should take a step back and realize that lining their pockets isn’t all that life is about and at a certain point of net worth, accumulating wealth doesn’t even bring happiness anymore and does not get you anything extra at the end of life. A more enriching way to go through life is by finding ways to bring joy and easing pain for others. Be selfless instead of selfish and I can guarantee when your time comes, you’ll look back and feel that your life truly had a purpose and your family will be honored to carry on your legacy.

Right now, you folks on Wall Street betting against and fighting back at this movement are no better than a street drug addict who steals. Desperate, scared, and has no other option than to fuck someone else over. That’s not the best legacy to leave behind. In fact, it’s down right disgraceful. The majority of you Wall Street folks should consider going through some therapy because your way of thinking is not normal. You got lucky, you are not special, and if you lack empathy you probably have some unaddressed trauma from your past.

**TLDR**: Selflessness will always make you feel better than selfishness. 

If you are against this movement you are proving to the world that you do in fact have severe mental issues and they are taking away your ability to create true happiness for yourself, you should talk with someone to help you through this. It is not too late to change your way of thinking towards other people.

If you read all of this, thank you. Obviously it doesn’t change anything, but I really thought you should all know that the generosity is appreciated and gives hope that people aren’t all bad. 

Stay strong ya’ll this shit **IS NOT OVER**."

The shorts want to bankrupt GME, we know that won’t happen because this company has Ryan Cohen as ceo. 

The shorts want to bring the price down as low as they can, but we keep buying the dips. If I’m honest, THE SHORTS ARE WINNING RIGHT NOW, but the short interest is still high, so they have to cover. 

#WE ARE SPENDING OUR CAPITAL BUYING THE DIPS, WHEN WE SHOULD HOLD OUR SHARES NOW, LET THE PRICE TANK, THEN BUY UP EVEN MORE SHARES 

Would you rather buy 3 shares for 80 a piece, just for the shorts to attack again tomorrow and the next day, day after day, or do you want to “let them” win, let the price tank, then buy up even more shares before they can cover? 

Spending 240 on 3 shares, or spending 240 on 24 shares at 10$ a piece WHILE eating up the available shares? I know which one sounds better to me. 






#THE SHORTS PLAN 


There’s a very plausible theory that the shorts want to bring the price down very cheaply, then they will buy far OTM calls, and trigger the squeeze themselves. Then once at the top they’ll buy puts and tank the price again. 


This allows them to 

#Cover 

#Make money on the upswing 

#Make money on the downswing 

#Possibly erase all of their losses and retain their investor base 



#TLDR: let the shorts drive the price down, DONT BUY THE DIP, just hold your shares you have now. And with your remaining capital watch the price tank, then snatch up 10x the amount of shares you would be able to during a normal dip.


#PLAY INTO THEIR HAND AND LET THEM THINK THEY’VE WON AND THAT WE GAVE UP. THEN THATS WHEN SHARES BECOME AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE TO SNATCH UP CHEAPLY."

What’s about to happen is trick the system, it is illegal but you stand to lose a couple million in a lawsuit vs billions in your bad shorting stocks. 

The hedge fund hatches a plan. Market markers and hedgefund friends are going to use stocks that they own and trade them very very quickly with each other at low low prices. The supply is still low, they are only trading a couple hundred or thousand stocks, but the system can’t recognize that its the same stocks being traded. Its just seeing the amount of times the same stock is being traded. So one stock being moved 5 times the system, sees as 5 different stocks, and therefore think the supply is high. 

Thing is, this only drives the price down. It doesn’t matter though, since you as someone who is holding isn’t selling at that price. It doesn’t matter what the price is at if no one is selling. See, the price decrease because the same stocks are being traded constantly tricking the system into thinking its multiple stocks being traded once, however since the price is too low for the people who are holding the other stocks they are not selling. The supply is still low. 

Why is this important? It is important because the hedge funds need to buy your stocks to close their positions. They literally cannot close their shorts unless they buy your stocks. This is why you are supposed to hold your stocks, no matter how low the price is. The price is a facade, they want you to sell at a price they are setting. If you are not selling even though the price is low, they cant buy. If they can’t buy, they can’t close their shorts. If they can’t close their shorts, they’ll have to pay interest. And if the interest becomes too much, they are going to be forced to buy your stocks at whatever price you offer. This is the squeeze. 

The squeeze starts when the hedge fund can’t afford to trick the system anymore since the interest on their shorts are getting too much. They’ll have to pay whatever we ask of them. If no one sells until 1000usd, they are going to be forced to pay that. If no one sells until 10000usd, they’ll have to pay that amount instead. When they are forced to close their positions, they will flood the marketplace with orders to buy. This is going to skyrocket the stocks, and the price will keep rising until people start selling. However, if you sell during the short ladder attacks, the squeeze wont happen. The price set during the attacks isn’t the actual price. It’s the price thats tricked into the system. 

This is why you HOLD no matter how much the price goes down. If everyone holds, there is no supply and if there is no supply it doesn’t matter how low the price is SINCE THERE IS LITERALLY NO ONE FOR THE HEDGE FUNDS TO BUY FROM so they can’t close their positions, they’ll have to keep paying for the interest and at some point, they WILL have to BUY YOUR STOCKS no matter the price."

1612322240.0,52,$CLOV,"I read Biden’s National Strategy for the covid-19 response and pandemic preparedness. There’s a ton of language in there about “strengthening essential data systems”. There is also an acknowledgment that such task may “require new technology”.

Some relevant language from strategy:

“Directs relevant federal agencies to collect, produce, share, analyze, and collaborate with respect to data supportive of COVID-19 response and recovery efforts.”

“Assist localities that struggle with public health infrastructure challenges that limit effective reporting or managing of COVID-19 data. The federal government will focus on states and localities that continue to struggle with antiquated data systems, especially jurisdictions that have trouble connecting testing laboratories and public health agencies to support case investigation, contact tracing, and support services for isolation of potentially exposed individuals. The federal government will work to surge personnel to assist with manual processes
in the near-term and develop data technologies to automate in the long-term.”

Where is all this new technology coming from? 🤷🏽‍♂️

In comes CLOV:

THE CLOVER ASSISTANT 

You have the exclusive opportunity to use Clover’s technology, the Clover Assistant. The Clover Assistant is designed by doctors for doctors to help enhance patient care and reduce administrative burden. We take advantage of Clover Health’s expansive data platform to deliver actionable and clear information, taking into consideration unique, patient-specific clinical data, needs, and circumstances. With a personalized design that focuses on proactive care, the Clover Assistant synthesizes and analyzes each patient’s information and makes real-time, personalized, dynamic, evidence-based recommendations right at the point of care.


ALSO read around and found that there have been a few bills introduced in congress over the past few months around data and privacy related to health. 

What do I think?

1. Biden = healthcare and he’s looking to score big there. This will be a focal point. You know ThE fIrSt 1o0 dAyS

2. The language in Elizabeth Warren’s bill is super specific about protections on how patient data is stored, anonymized, and shared. Okay... 

3. Pharmacy’s partner up with fed for covid vaccination and the day before clover issued a statement around getting covid vaccines. 


4. Now all of that sounds great. However, why the sudden rush to introduce bills that are clearly addressing a concern around patient’s health data? It raises all sorts if questions for me like:

Who’s collecting this data that you’re so worried about its use and privacy?

Where are these concerns coming from? What is it that we are protecting ourselves from? Is that not weird y’all? Anyway, I guess the point there is that there is clearly some big push to collect and use our patient data by the government (pretty scary imo). Plus you know, google backed Clover. Which leads me to believe, based on the language around new technology in Biden’s initiative, that they are going to have to acquire this technology from somewhere. Where from though? 


Anyway, I’m excited to see how this narrative plays out in the coming weeks and months. Healthcare is a heavy political space, especially under Biden. Based on recent news, something is brewing. Too many coincidences lining up.

1612322227.0,3933,GME and $80 Stocks. Why to not worry.," 

>Oh my god! GME is down to $150! It's down to $100! It's down to 30 cents! The hedgies are going to cover all their shorts at that 30cent price point! It's over!

Wrong.

No one is selling at these prices. Sure, maybe a few scared folk who don't know any better. Maybe they trigger a few stop losses. Maybe some margins get called. But it's not enough. Say it with me:

*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*

>WHAT?!

You heard me. 30cent GME? No problem.

They don't need a low price, they need your shares. If 10 people sell at 30c cents, and that's the only market activity, it's a ""30 cent stock"" but Melvin only netted ten shares. They are still fucked. *They aren't buying 50 million shares at 30c, nor $100, nor $300, and that's their problem.* It's an availability issue. Sometimes it's ALSO a price issue (too high for them) but primarily it's the availability.

All the activity driving down the listed share price are *illegal ladder attacks* (not that legality should be expected at this point, these folk are crooks). Those aren't actual sales though, it's just shares trading hands from hedgie to hedgie. They aren't gobbling up value. These people don't admit defeat, they are neither smart nor humble, they are crooks. They need 50 million+ shares. They need over 100% of the float to sell to them (that 50% float you hear about is accounting shennaigans, ignore it, they are still exposed). *You can NOT close that many positions sniping a few shaky handed noobs.* We aren't talking about a few shares they need to buy, we're talking about fucking ALL OF THEM.

I'll explain that in a second, but first let me repeat:

*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*

So let's say you want to buy 50 million shares, let's look at what shares are being asked for in my hypothetical example market:

**# of Shares - Price**

x 20 - $0.30c

x 80 - $5

x 400 - $20

x 600 - $40

x 900 - $60

x 2,000 - $100

x 5,000 - $150

x 10,000 - $200

x 30,000 - $300

x 50,000 - $400

x 150,000 - $500

x 1 mil - $1,000

x 15 mil - $5,000

x 30 mil - $69,420

Get it? There are only a few people willing to sell at those low prices. By the time you've bought a quarter million shares (0.5% of what you need to buy) you're back up to the sustained highs. And these are just exaggerations to make a point. *A stock price only reflects current trade values, not availability at those prices*. If the hedgies are trading their shares back and forth to each other to drive down the price and they have ladder attacked down to a Nickel, that doesn't mean anyone's shares are only worth pocket change, that just means that that is what things are trading at in the moment. There's no volume to buy up at those costs. No one can force you to sell at a Nickel.

Get it?

*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*

They need our shares, not a low price. The price does not reflect whether we are 'winning' or not. Their financial reserves indicate that, but there isn't a ticker for that. But be sure, every day the inevitable closes in. Sell out of fear if you like, but you'll just miss out in the end. People like me, as we shore up more funds, snipe these low prices, stealing away shares the hedgies use to ladder and taking shares away from shaky hands and putting them into steady ones.

How's it going apes, I've been lurking since the covid market crash, and have recently been seeing a lot of sensible posts that make it seem like the squeeze has squozen, and all of the shorts have been covered. Maybe the media wasn't lying. Maybe the posts are getting into the one wrinkle my smooth brain has left. We'll see.

I'm just posting to see if anyone can reference me to evidence or good DD that can refute some of these ideas, but some of the things aren't adding up.

First things first: This sub has gotten pretty hive mind-y. A lot of the DD posted is grounded in speculation, or the idea that everyone is out to get us and no one is on our side. It's naive, but let's assume no one was lying, and that the media isn't out to get us. They're just lazy and writing easy articles with little to no research for those yummy clicks.

Let's kick this off.

# 1. The Hedgies covered their short positions?

Around the height of the squeeze, the media was claiming that the hedge funds have closed out their short positions. This was refuted by the fact that [short interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortinterest.asp) hadn't decreased, but potentially increased. [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/layb68/rstocks_gme_megathread/glsjpx9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) poses a really good argument as to why this is possible. Basically, it's saying that the jump to 500 was the squeeze, and they re-opened shorts at a better position. That was us winning, the hedge funds cut their losses. We interpreted that as them ""Doubling Down"". Now we're the bagholders, and this ""war of attrition"" will be us slowly selling our shares as more and more of us realize that the game is over.

# 2. Volume! No one is selling! Look at the volume spike and the price spike this morning!

The price spike this morning was the gamma squeeze. The seller of the contract has T+2 days to deliver the shares. They obviously waited for the share price to be as low as possible, because they knew the squeeze was over. We're against people who have much more money and education in this field. Why would they not try to maximize their profits as well? I don't think holding does anything but decrease liquidity. The people buying isn't them, it's us.

# 3. DFV didn't sell! Mark Cuban said to hold!

I haven't actually dug through post / comment history, so correct me if I am wrong. But I think DFV is in it for the long haul, he *genuinely* likes the stock. I don't think his plan was to make a quick buck off of a squeeze. And Mark Cuban said to hold *if you believed in the company*, he said not to sell if your reason for buying hasn't changed. Well, if the squeeze squoze, would that not be the reason changing? I didn't see him reference the squeeze itself, and whether or not we were winning. Rather, *we did the right thing.*

&#x200B;

I hate to be a debbie downer, but I don't drink and I am sober enough to see the party's over. We won, kind of. I'm still balls deep, diamond handing on a wish that GME takes off to the moon. I just need some reassurance, because all the DD in the past couple days hasn't been grounded enough to convince me that we're still in for a ride. Whatever happens, we're in this together.

I’m still holding shares but have lost all of money. You may think I’m a retard for gambling with more than I could lose. You are absolutely right, am retarded. However, I think it’s important we draw attention to this, yes it’s the institutions fault for stealing our gains by manufacturing an impossible to win playing field. But at the same time it’s important to turn inward and ask oneself- why monke so retarded, why monke have one banana when monkey had 6 banana. Basically I’m a stupid monke who refuses to let go his last banana. But this sub didn’t always used to be like this. Will GME still moon? If we are tactical and precise and stronk 🚀🚀🚀, I can see it happening if we really focus our efforts and communication. Yea it’s fun to spam but there’s so many damn bots and ways of deceiving and diverting us. For those of us who lost money they weren’t prepared to lose so quickly- please get actual help by reaching out to loved ones and fellow 🦍 . You don’t need to tell everyone irl about your losses, in fact don’t, but find one maybe two people who can support you during these times. Personally I reached out to my 🦍 dad because I’m so autistic I got him to go in on GME too. He’s a boomer so he paper handed but he still has gains. I do not anymore. But I am holding on for something greater at this point. So if this resonates with anyone please feel free to tell your story below. I’m down $30k on GME and still holding.. let’s keep the dream alive but make sure not to lose our head along the way. Also we can write this off in our taxes and become better traders in the future. It will all make sense soon enough and when GME moons, tomorrow, Thursday, or even if it takes months, we will finally do as the tendieman once said- take our gains and go.

1612320858.0,165,Dear Secretary Yellen,"If you truly do believe in the integrity of the markets as well as fair and efficient markets.

Also, can you please explain how these hedge funds which offer zero benefit to society are allowed by you to counterfeit shares so that upwards of 130% of every GameStop share ever invented was sold short? In addition, I am curious how the short sellers are able to cover their shorts if many of us 7,000,000 wallstreetbets users have never sold our shares back to anyone?

**Thesis:**

Goldman Sachs and the big boys have deleveraged their stake in GME and said they are reducing risk while also calling what already happened as the squeeze and that other hedges deleveraged as well. I can't tell if this is FUD or if they truly believe this. This info is in their daily customer subscription mailers, only actual GS customers get these mailers afaik. I don't know what is the truth anymore.

If Yellen wants to meet for volatility on a fizzling stock that is 98.4% ish locked in by buyers, this screams all kinds of alarms in my head. They are either going to try and stop the party or they are looking for money to pay us and not crash everything at the same time.

Tomorrow is the final fight. Yellen and all the bigwigs are the bosses.

Also i think it makes sense for the squeeze to happen this week before Friday due to the naked short puts the HFTs have been selling that are likely 2/05 of expiry. They DO NOT want this squeeze to happen next week when all those shorts are gone and the price is back way up. They also don't want the squeeze to happen on Friday due to the extreme volatility due to their naked 2/05 puts.

If all that makes sense, this means that the squeeze is coming tomorrow or the day after and NOT next week or this Friday.

1612320724.0,130,"Why this fight isn't over: they want to shake you out, high or low.","The thesis is forming in my head now... We've seen how much the MM can manipulate anything... A lot of people believe the lies--the official reports--I've finally resigned to the feeling that I know I'm being lied to... That the enemy still has something at stake here, and that we can profit from it.

This is how the lord of lies works; he relies on you to do what is rational, because facts are the only thing the lord of lies can control...

So, what we've seen isn't a paying down of shorts...

It's the MM manipulating the price to convince you to fold your hand... They put it up to see if you'll cash in... They'll put it down to see if you'll cash out...

I think there will be a big squeeze soon--but the reason won't be because of fundamentals--it will be because the last squeeze didn't get you to fold your hand.

The big question is: why do they have to play against our hand of they can cheat? What we do know is that a lot of shares are coming back with a ""failure to deliver""--meaning these MM are injecting fake shares into the economy; this is all we've known until now...

Another question is: who holds the real shares, and who holds the fake shares?

But where is the thesis about how these fake shares can be used? And why?

For the sake of this thesis, I have to assume that the MM are accountable to the SEC, the government or the banking systems at large\~\~so, if we're to see news break of this, and trials had, it will have to be because the MM couldn't kick the can any further down the road, and their lie was exposed... 📷

There are a lot of people involved in this whole chain of operations. Some people are able to collude together, but the system as a whole can't be all in on one conspiracy together...

What I expect to see, weeks from now at most, is that the MM are exposed, for who they are, and what they're doing--hopefully entirely--and that we'll be closer to exposing the perfidy that has unfolded underneath of us.

There's a reason none of us feel right... Why we feel uneasy, and like we've been cheated--we saw it right before our eyes, and we're gaslighted--and then it all blew over, like everything is normal...

But we still see signs of the fight brewing underneath.

[http://www.sportstwo.com/posts/5089795/](http://www.sportstwo.com/posts/5089795/)

Read this person's post. He talks in depth about ""failure to deliver"" shares... There's a piece missing to this puzzle, and it isn't to do with how much short interest is left...

We keep seeing them pay that down and rebuying into shares for a reason...

There's manipulation there. Probably them manipulating the short interest to combat this narrative that there will be a short squeeze.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbavu0/the\_ratio\_of\_short\_volume\_to\_total\_volume/?utm\_medium=android\_app&utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbavu0/the_ratio_of_short_volume_to_total_volume/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

This guy might be on to something... Something feels like it's missing... I guess my gut says a squeeze can still happen. My mind is fighting me.

So, they're going to hike the price again perhaps end of this week... They'll try to shake you out at $1,000 a share.

This is the thesis... What happens at the end of this?

1612320640.0,206,Alrite You Lennys... Let's Talk Non-Squoze DD...,"For everyone stuck holding a $400 share and wondering where this goes from here... (Why aren't you cost averaging down?)

Let's look at GameStops current metrics.

GameStops current market cap at $90 is $6.5bil.

On last earnings, GME reported $1bil in revenue with -$18mil in net income.

They made $1,000,000,000 in revenue in 3 months, and they need to save $18,000,000 per quarter to turn a profit. Any improvements they make to the operations is going to keep pushing them farther into the green. They couldn't do much worse than last year with the pandemic...

...but instead they are about to have their largest quarter in recent history. Hear me out...

Between the dual-release of the PS5 and the XBOX, console sales will be a huge boost. But that is expected...

The other new market that no one is discussing is Trading Cards. Pokemon and Magic TCG both had a HUGE year. With card shops being shut down, a very large amount of sales went through GameStop because scalpers were clearing out big box retailers.

And GameStop takes pre-orders for them.

My local GameStop put a limit on 20 pre-orders per person so that they could try to guarantee allocation. 20 per customer... And they had to limit it...

GameStop has extra cash in the bank from the PreOrders for the next Shiny Vault Pokemon set coming out... So they actually have cash on the books in advance for this upcoming earnings report. You're going to see a huge surprise.

Their new partial owner, Ryan Cohen, took Chewy up against Amazon and won. And he brought his best team with him to GameStop. GameStop did 35% of their revenue through online sales in October. Wait until RC streamlines it and builds a market around the brand name recognition...

So ask yourself...

Does a $6bil cap company with $1bil in Quarterly Revenue (quarterly...), on the cusp of turning a profit, and with the best online sales team in the market sound like a decent investment to you?

Because that is what GameStop at $90 is...

Hold on my fellow Lennys. The long term looks good from here. $100 is going to be a floor soon. Sky's the ceiling...

Even without a squeeze...

Remember how it's a giant mystery as to who has had a short position on gme and we were just going off a rumor mill for months that it was Melivin (well until Melvin publicly reported almost going out of business).  So it turns out since 2010 when the Dodd-Frank act was signed into law investing managers have been required to to disclose short positions, just like they do their longs.  The SEC just chooses not to implement this.  Considering naked short attacks are what took down the banks in '08 turning that mess into a crisis, it's crazy the SEC doesn't have to respect federal law.  The law itself is giant, but there's also a bunch of public comments on the SEC site encouraging them to actually do their job:

The above is fitting in so many ways, as are many other famous quotes from a long time ago... We may be in a modernized digital world, but the fundamentals remain the same.

This is a long post, and I apologize but rather than just join the echo chamber, and shout 💎🤲🚀 etc.. Let's take a minute and really assess where we're at and where we've come from. This IS NOT telling ANYONE to 📄🤲 .. Quite the opposite in fact.

As it stands I bought at $325, the night shit really turned pear shaped (on paper) and I watched the initial investment jump up to just short of $500.. I was grinning about it, thinking I'd timed it just right..

Moments later, the market was halted, share buying restricted, prices began to plunge.

And continue to plunge.. day after day.

I have then watched the shit storm unfold between then and now, but I've learnt a BUNCH and become almost addicted to wanting to know more.

&#x200B;

**KNOWLEDGE IS POWER**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We have all heard this a MILLION times in our lives, but it's true. And the more you educate yourself about this current situation, regardless of how it resolves, the more it will help us all in the future. This is just the beginning.

The market will not be the same after this, the SEC investigators, super autistic apes, politicians, billionaires, people from ALL walks of life, and levels of varying smooth brains will look further into this and explain clearly how it all went down. Lap the knowledge up. It will help you in the future as part of WSB or solo.. it **WILL** help.

I mean fuck. Netflix is already making a movie. People will be talking about this for a long time yet as the trade that changed how Wall Street does business. (I agree with all the others too.. give them a happy ending! 💎🤲)

What I'm getting at is this kind of fuckery with the ladder attacks, the blatant FUD campaigns on the media, the bots, the busted brokers, trolls and everything else that has been thrown against you is you learned.

You learned what Wall Street is capable of, what they will stoop to, what to expect next time, how they are doing this, the tactics they use.. And just for a second, place yourself in their shoes.

The big guys have the lifestyle that many of you can only dream about, and if you have that.. you will do \*ANYTHING\* to protect it. The rich don't get rich by being charitable, and sharing their wealth freely with the smaller guys. They get rich by TAKING, USING, and ABUSING and employing any tactic they can to their advantage to achieve their end goal of financial domination.

&#x200B;

**We're different.**

&#x200B;

For the first time, in the history of the internet we  have come together - People say it could have been any company.. But think about this:

GameStop (EB Games for us Aussies) is a place where you STILL go, regardless of Steam, Epic (yuck), GOG, and all the other online retailers..

GameStop shutting its doors, would be similar to when the old arcades (Time Zone excluded..) shut their doors, and became a thing of the past.

How many times have you walked through a shopping center and stopped in to your local GameStop or EB Games and browsed for a gift for a loved one, a quirky new shirt, the pre-owned console games, D&D stuff.. The list goes on.

**GameStop is still relevant** \- And by the luck of the gaming gods **$GME** was the share that the big brains ( Yes, people like /r/deepfuckingvalue ) spotted and deemed to be a good investment.

&#x200B;

Now, think further along - If the stocks were something mundane... like **Gourds** (Fuck off copy pasta bots.. you're mildly annoying and none of us care. We enjoy clicking the 💩 reactions on your repetitive, shitposts)

Do you think the online community would have rallied and banded together internationally to support it? Fuck no.

This is a magical, rare, fucking unicorn of a stock. It's circumstances, and nature of the company tied into a neat little package for us to love and hold.. (forever 💎🤲)

We are gamers, we are tech savvy, we have the ability to open broker accounts online without any previous experience, we know how to research more than just using Google, we are the perfect audience to start a global movement. Which we have done.

So when the whispers of WSB began, and word slowly began to spread around the interwebs, you guys heard it. You took the time to investigate.. and shit post a lot.. and come up with almost a whole new sub culture lingo to go with it (Okay, maybe WSB had that for a long time before the new arrivals.. but we love it)

The point is, you spent time, learned and I implore you to keep learning until that smooth brain.. isn't so smooth.

# We are the perfect demographic and GME is the perfect stock for us and those two factors have lead us to a point where the entire world, gamers or not have become involved. This. Is. Huge.

Right now there is a lot going in our favour - **Do not judge this epic event by the share price alone.**

*Initially I wanted to post pics, graphs, explanations about everything you can readily find online so you would be educated, so you would know that this isn't over yet, far from it in fact. But, the more I look around, the more I see people who just need a nudge to investigate things themselves.*

&#x200B;

**REMEMBER: KNOWLEDGE IS POWER**

Due Diligence is needed. Invest only what you can afford or risk. No-one can tell you specifically what is best for you so RESEARCH that smooth brain.

This is why AMC is going to be the next best thing since sliced bread:
All of the other movie theater companies had already filed for bankruptcy. This leaves AMC Theatres as The Last Man Standing. They just raised over $700M in additional funding which clears them of any short-term bankruptcies up coming 🤑

There is an enormous amount of pent-up demand for entertainments especially Sports and movies. Where is everyone going to go once things go back to normal? They're going to go to the only place left in town and that's AMC 🏚🏚🏠

Well you may be thinking ""This stock was $3 a month ago why should I buy it at $7?""
Because 💎🙌 autists are holding those bags up baby, just buy now or cry later. 

AMC is seen as a value stock versus Gamestop considering the inflated valuations. Dollar for dollar youre better off buying the cheaper of the two, for unit bias and also because...

The daily fund requirements brokers have to deposit with their clearing houses increased because GME was too volatile and because there were way more buys than sells at popular brokers. 

Does it mean that if, hypothetically, buyers :

- spread their buys on multiple days/weeks, in order to lower volatility

- move some of the GME stocks they already have from the most popular brokers to other less exposed brokers, in order to lower the quantity of GME held by the more popular brokers and also to make room for newer investors who tend to use popular platforms 

Then brokers would be in the clear and could lift restrictions?

To all of you who are out there who’ve ever thought “oh man, if I’d only bought X stock X years ago I’d be rich!” - if you aren’t holding right now, you’re wrong. 

I’m an actual investor, not a swing/day trader (I know, gay) and I went all in on TSLA back in 2019, so I had days where my account would lose 20% of its value. Weeks where it would lose half. I didn’t sell a share as it went from $960 to $330 pre-split. Nor the $460-$300 drop post-split. These are just a few examples. 

I bought GME because in a worst case scenario some crazy illegal shit happens and I now have a long term position in a solid company. I covered my cost basis in tranches on the way up and now I’m holding the remaining 300 shares with house money. If it’s too late for you to do that, take it as a lesson for next time.  What was Melvin’s mistake? No actual hedging. Don’t be a Melvin. . 

A good investment requires holding 9/10 times. The overnight million dollar plays are very rare, because they take a higher ratio of luck than confidence. This shit is a lot like dating - your confidence won’t help if you’re making shitty picks, but your good picks will never pan out without confidence. $GME has my confidence- the numbers are in our favor. And so, I hold. And I sleep like a baby at night. I have 300 shares, and I’ve lost a nauseating amount of money the past two days. 

But I don’t give a fuck. 

Hold, relax, forget about it. We own the stock, we aren’t the ones bleeding interest. As much as the hedges have their cheating, we have nuclear bombs too- one whale, one great piece of news, one exercising of stock options by a certain Ryan Cohen... I could go on. 

It’s not a sure thing, but anyone acting like we’re in dire straits probably didn’t comprehend what was going on in the first place. Just shut the fuck up and hold.

1612319421.0,255,Let's talk about taxes: both realized gains and realized losses (USA only),"I know everybody is getting super excited about GME, AMC, NOK, or BB going 🚀🚀🚀, but have you thought about taxes? I am not a tax advisor, but I did some research and wanted to make you guys aware of these things before the next tax season comes around and your jaws drop because Uncle Sammy wants a cut of your tendies.

**LET'S START WITH CAPITAL LOSSES:**

I know a handful of you do not care if you end up holding the bag. But also consider this: you can use these losses to **REDUCE YOUR TAX BILL**. You can only do this if you do not have any capital gains or your capital losses is greater than your capital gains for the year (you have more losses than gains). Unfortunately you can **only deduct up to $3,000 per year** ($1,500 if married filing separately), so please don't risk more than you can afford. If you do happen to lose more than $3,000, I suggest only selling some shares at a time each year (probably around December) up to a loss of $3,000. The deduction used to be $4,000 so it can change year to year. **(Please see edit below for losses >$3,000).**

**CAPITAL GAINS (WHEN YOU COLLECT YOUR TENDIES):**

There are two different capital gains you can realize after you sell your shares: short term (<=1 year) and long term (>1 year).

Short term gains are taxed as ordinary income. What does that mean? It's essentially added together with your salary.

**Marginal Rates:** For tax year 2021, the top tax rate remains 37% for individual single taxpayers with incomes greater than $523,600 ($628,300 for married couples filing jointly). The other rates are:

* 35%, for incomes over $209,425 ($418,850 for married couples filing jointly);
* 32% for incomes over $164,925 ($329,850 for married couples filing jointly);
* 24% for incomes over $86,375 ($172,750 for married couples filing jointly);
* 22% for incomes over $40,525 ($81,050 for married couples filing jointly);
* 12% for incomes over $9,950 ($19,900 for married couples filing jointly).
* The lowest rate is 10% for incomes of single individuals with incomes of $9,950 or less ($19,900 for married couples filing jointly).

Long term gains follow a different set of rules as follows:

These are just general information. Please consult with a tax advisor as everyone's financial situations are different.

Also: there's a handful of you making donations which is freaking awesome. You should save those receipts as those donations can also be used to deduct your taxes. I currently cannot find info that would make sense (I guess I'm just as retarded as everyone else here). *(Edit: This only applies if you do an itemized deduction. Too lazy and complicated for me unless you have a smart tax advisor)*

If you got anything else I should add or inaccuracies in these info, I'll be sure to edit them. If this doesn't get approved as a post, then I just wasted the last few hours researching and typing this up.

***Full Disclosure: I am not a tax advisor. I'm as retarded as most of you and probably planning on taking advantage of the tax deduction if I end up holding the bag because*** **💎🤲🏼**.

&#x200B;

Edit 1: Net **capital losses** in excess of $3,000 can be **carried forward** indefinitely until the amount is exhausted. Due to the wash-sale IRS rule, investors need to be careful not to repurchase any stock sold for a **loss** within 30 days, or the **capital loss** does not qualify for the beneficial tax treatment."

Thanks to [a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb6aiq/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_03_2021/glt6vxo?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from /u/Guildish, I was prompted to look into how to prevent my $GME shares from being used by hedge funds for the short ladder attacks we've been seeing these past couple days. Our brokerages are allowed to lend out our shares as long as there are no open orders on them. So, put a daily sell limit order on all of your shares (at a reasonable 3x-4x the price that day) so that they can't be lent out. A website I also found helpful information from:

[https://www.contracts-for-difference.com/borrowing-lending-shares.html](https://www.contracts-for-difference.com/borrowing-lending-shares.html)

Stay strong, buy the dips, and hold, fellow retards!

Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I just like the stock. I am a retard and please do your research.

&#x200B;

Edit: I am not advising anyone. I bought 15 shares at \~$290 last Wednesday, and tomorrow I'm putting my daily sell limit order at $5k lmao. And probably buying more tomorrow!

Edit 2: I’ve noticed my email shows some comments that look like they didn’t make it through due to new accounts/low karma, but I’ll try to answer the genuine questions through edits. Someone asked what platform I am using, and I use Vanguard. I’ve never had any issues with them, and they don’t limit how many $GME or $AMC shares I can buy.

Edit 3: Buying stocks with Vanguard is pretty straightforward. If you need help, feel free to PM me. Someone mentioned that the short ladders cause a placement of an artificial ceiling, meaning huge gains can’t be made. I’m not an expert by any means whatsoever, but if you look at the 2008 VW squeeze chart, that proves not to be true. Also, someone mentioned TD Ameritrade is limiting the sell limit. Go as high as it will let you, and if you don’t feel comfortable with that, it’s okay. If worse comes to worst, get a Vanguard account, buy shares through them, and set your sell limits to the stars.

Edit 4: Do not buy your shares on margin! A few of you have let me know that shares bought with cash accounts cannot be used for short attacks. Not sure if you all can see their comment, but /u/Germanicusss has advised to “pay down your margin debt and/or instruct your broker to move the shred into your cash account”. I need to do more research into that. Another reminder that this is not financial advise and I’m not an expert. For those of you telling me (with malicious intent) that I’m a retard, tell me something I don’t know."

Looking at the above site.  There are links to information about Failed to deliver.[https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm)

Is GME considered a Threshold Security ✅

>In  order to be deemed a  threshold security, and thus subject to the  restrictions of Rule  203(b)(3), a security must exceed the specified  fail level for a period  of five consecutive settlement days.   Similarly, in order to be removed  from the list of threshold  securities, a security must not exceed the  specified level of fails for  a period of five consecutive settlement  days.

Does the Firm have to close out the positions? ✅

>As adopted, Rule 203(b)(3) requires any participant of a registered clearing agency (""participant"")[80](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P210_72014) to take action on all failures to deliver that exist in such securities ten days after the normal settlement date, *i.e.*, 13 consecutive settlement days.[81](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P211_72496)Specifically, the participant is required to close out the fail to   deliver position by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.  
>  
>Rule 203(b)(3) is intended to address potential abuses that may occur with large, extended fails to deliver.[89](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P221_79239)  We believe that the five-day requirement will facilitate the identification of securities with extended fails.

So  Dumb-ass me looked further back in time to the second half of  December.  It looks like GME has been failing to deliver CONSTANTLY.   This means that there are shares that Brokers HAVE to buy.  We are over the 10/13 Day limit.  What's going on here.  How can this single security CONSTANTLY fail to deliver almost every day... clearly something is going on here....  How are they CONSTANTLY failing?  Well,  that's because there are shares that are made up, it has to be.  This is shorted STILL beyond belief as of the 15th.

Do you bother fucking reading anything? Ever? I mean, I get it, I write walls of text... but DFV uploads a single picture and you can't even bother reading that picture... Come on, that's prime savant! You literally cannot be helped if you're one of these people.

Here's what I mean,

[This is one of the first few posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d31bke/gme_yolo_update_following_the_q2_earnings_report/) by DFV uploaded on Sep 11, 2019.

All other things ignored, do you notice something? **Look at the ""CASH"" pile. It reads: $13,962.21**

Great, remember that fucking number because we're going to progress through this fiasco of ""he hasn't sold"".

I'm not gonna bother with a daily, or monthly reminder of how great DFV is at risk management. So let's skip a few months and head straight to [December 17 2020, here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kf69j1/gme_yolo_update_dec_17_2020/).

Notice something odd? Something remarkable? **The cash pile reads $1,105,069.48.**

Alright, maybe he just added a million more to his account by taking a HELOC against his rented house (how's that possible, I don't fucking know, anything's possible on wsb). But let's extend the usual WSB benefit of the doubt to DFV, because that's the least we can do. We're going to ignore the voice of reason and just say the dude took out 1mill against his mortgage to blow on GME YOLOs.

Cool, let's move on.

Do you notice a trend, you smooth-brained jizz rocket? I really hope you do.

DFV, time and time again has proven to be a great investor. How could he not be, he hunts VALUE stocks, not YOLOs. His thesis on GME wasn't driven by a squeeze, but rather a company that was being sold on the market for cheaper than it was worth. Watch his videos, and you'll find that.

He just truly stuck by his thesis and the squeeze was the cherry on top of the cake... and while you idiots keep thinking he's not selling because all you read is the ""Total pile"", you're failing to realize he probably has brilliant stop losses that have taken his $50k to nearly $14m already. And as always, he's letting the rest ride. This is called... letting the winners ride.

You'll also notice his rolling of the options, and I don't know if they are strategic, but they are brilliant. Another indicator of him not being smooth brained.

Now, read his future daily updates carefully. I'm out.

**TLDR:** You're a savant, you don't need a TLDR... but I'll try. DFV has cashed out $14m worth of gains, and the top comment is always ""If he's still in, I'm still in"". In reality, DFV has fucked the game on so many levels, the game now calls him daddy. Rightfully so.

1612319133.0,0,The game is up nobody should be putting money into GME right now,"Downvote and call me paperhanded me all you want but I'm off the GME Galactic and i've booked a healthy profit from it. 

Not financial advice. 

I wrote this on Monday night after selling on Monday morning but i feel the sentiment still holds true. 

Back in December when i started GME was at around 16. I averaged up to 36.84 last monday but i took out my initial invest when it got up to 447. I sold the rest yesterday at 275. Do i regret not selling when it was 400+? Yes. Am i happy with what i've got? Absolutely. 

At some stage WSB becomes an echo chamber and if you get sucked in you're investing/betting on emotion rather than making logical decisions about what to do with your money. 

Back in December when /u/uberkikz11 and /u/deepfuckingvalue had their posts up with the  proposition for GME being undervalued it was a compelling case and and threw a bit of money in. Q3 ER came in and the SP tanked but i held because the investment thesis hadn't changed. Last monday i sold nearly everything else i had in my portfolio to put into GME so that at the end it was 77% of my entire holdings which i think was the right decision (YOLOL). But after seeing what happened on Thursday and then doing some reading over the weekend i got worried that the train was slowing and decided to sell everything yesterday. 

I don't think that theres anybody who doesn't realise that GME is speculation and if you actually believe that its a good investment i think you're wrong. There was a specific set of circumstances that helped bring GME to where it is now and those circumstances have changed significantly with the limiting of purchasing. 

Back to what i said earlier about WSB being an echo chamber. There were 2m-ish people on the sub on Monday. Now? Its at 8m. Its fucking crazy. I'm not some tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist but you have to at the very least believe that different people will have different agendas and this is doubly so for 7m people. You form your own opinions but if everybody is saying buy then its always a good idea to find reasons not to buy so you have a balanced viewpoint. Even DFV himself when posting up his thesis for GME asked people to critique his logic. If you aren't actively seeking out other opinions you're doing yourself a disservice and you risk getting mired in the ""HLOD"" bog. 

Andrew Left's first hitjob video was a hilarious catalyst but he does say one thing that made total sense - know who is on the other side of the trade. WSBers like to convince themselves that we know what high short interest means but do we actually know? Do we know who is on the other side of the GME trade? I'd recommend going to take a look at some of /u/laminar_flo 's posts. While some of his posts come off as very HF elitist he does make some valid points about Wall Street in general and how Melvin might actually have already exited this trade. So back to the question - do we know who's on the other end of this trade? I think with all the HDOL-ing there are some people who can't hack the volatility and are selling so this means that its just retards selling to other retards on the way down. (as an aside i do actually have to commend Citron's second video. I think he realised that by becoming a predatory short himself he actually joined the establishment and didn't want to be part of it). 

A lot of people follow what other WSBs do on the sub and DFV is our current god and saviour but saying you're not selling if hes still in is silly. He's sitting on $14m, are you? The thing that worried me over the weekend was seeing people throwing in various funds (retirement, wedding, college fund etc) into this trade expecting it to only go up. Yes stonks go up if there is a solid reason for going up and at this stage nobody know if GME will go up down or sideways. You know the story about the shoeshine boys? People YOLO-ing into stocks without any DD are the current version of those shoeshiners. 

On WSB everybody wants to make money but nobody wants to be left holding the bag. Asking others to get in now is irresponsible and people will get hurt from this. The people trying to cajole people to buy the dip or HDLO are essentially asking others to hold the bag while they look for an exit. Don't fall into the trap. 

I could absolutely be wrong. If it goes up to 500+ this week or next i'd be happy for you but at the same time i'm happy with what i have. I'm not keen on the volatility and i think there are better trades out there. 

What have i learned from this whole thing?

1) Have a target in mind and when you get there consider how you'd like to exit. 

2) Don't invest anymore than you can afford to lose. 

3) do your own DD. Read more than one opinion get as many facts as you can and then use those to build a gut feeling."

[Here is a blog entry](https://stu2b50.dev/posts/why-robinhood-d3580b) attempting to explain the calculation.

As far as I understand, the situation is like this.  RH needs to maintain an amount of cash (maybe with DTCC, but possibly just separately within RH since they have their own clearing house) that, with 99% probability, will cover the entirety of the cash needed to cover their unsettled T+2 positions.  This is generally much smaller than the actual buy volume on a given day because the amount that's due two days later is max(vol_buy - vol_sell, 0).  Let's call this the net buy volume (NBV).  In a situation where RH is buying and selling in an unbiased way, this would be on the order of sqrt{vol_buy} since sell proceeds offset buy proceeds (not for a particular symbol, but *across the entire portfolio*).

It seems highly unlikely to me that most of the buy volume on Tues/Wed last week was from cash, and not also from sale of equities.  And, moreover, if it was from cash, then in order for the NBV to remain high, it would require a constant influx of cash into RH accounts.  Therefore I assume that the massive increase in deposit requirements actually came from the ""99%"" requirement and a massive increase in the estimated variance of the NBV on DTCC's part.

But the fucking situation is not symmetrical.  If RH did suddenly adopt a huge net long position (due to users primarily buying $GME), then the volatility to the *sell side* becomes huge, but not the volatility to the buy side.  But a huge move to the sell side is not risky to DTCC.  They want more deposits to protect the net buy side.  This isn't modeled by a normal distribution because the only way to keep having massive NBV is for users to keep depositing proportional equity (since selling other equities to buy $GME cancels out).

Of course, DTCC knows this, but it seemed like they had RH over a barrel, and if they could depress buying to limit their own exposure, that was a fortuitous consequence.

Finally, why didn't RH then adopt this position:  You could only buy $GME with equity from selling other shares.  This would make that user's contribution to the net buy volume zero.  It would also mitigate the problem of $GME causing an increase in the net buy volume.  And, moreover, it would have drastically lessened the manipulative effect on the markets, allowing people to mostly keep buying $GME."

All I want to do is bring awareness to the volume. Look at the shiny graph above. Take a second to look at the volume by price range (the red and green sideways bar), the volume (in blue), and then the volume rate of change (green graph at the bottom). When the stonk was beginning to take off, volume was high with modest rates of change in volume. What does this mean?  Well, what you'd expect: people hearing of the stonk and buying more. As it peaked, volume dropped. Interestingly, volume rate of change was low (and even negative at one point). Both of these were low until today, and yet the stonk kept falling - what does this tell you? Hint: check some of the top posts in this sub. Coupled with the volume by price, there seems to be a net buying interest. I want to now point out the hump in the volume rate of change corresponding to today. Notice how the first hump happened early in the day as the stonk continued to plummet. Based on some WSB sentiment, this is likely scare tactics working and cuckies fearing the worst and selling off to lock in gains (or limit losses). But more importantly, notice the big peak in rate of change as the stonk dropped. People are seeing this offer as a discount and buying in. Coupled with all the other theories with what hedge funds and RH (etc.) are doing, we can reasonably infer that these scare tactics are working. I mean, why wouldn't they? We are shitting bricks. I expect more red dildo days. You know what that means right? Stonkies go downsies =  buy the dip.

*Redefining gaming, eSports, and streaming*

Company Overview

Corsair Gaming is an American computer hardware and peripherals company founded in 1994 and headquartered in California.

They acquired Elgato Gaming in 2018 to expand to the streaming gear market, Origin PC and SCUF gaming in 2019 to expand into the custom-built PC systems and console controllers markets, respectively, and during 2020 they acquired Gamer Sensei and EpocCam, and partnered with Pipeline to grow into the gaming and streaming coaching market.

Corsair went public on September 23, 2020, with its IPO priced at $17, valuing the company at about $1.3B.

Understanding the Business

**Value Proposition**

Corsair provides specialized, high-performance gear for gamers and streamers. Their products are designed to provide speed and reliability for competitive gaming, high quality content for streamers, and powerful PC components that allows gamers to run modern games smoothly.

**Revenue Streams**

Currently, Corsair groups its product offering into two segments: gamer and creator peripherals and gaming components and systems.

Gamer and Creator Peripherals:

which represents around 25% of net revenue, includes gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets, streaming gear, and high performance console controllers.

Gaming Components Systems:

which represents around 75% of net revenue includes computer cases, power supply units (PSU), high performance memory products (40% of net revenue), and custom-built gaming systems.

Acquisitions and Partnerships:

During 3Q 2020 Corsair acquired Gamer Sensei, a gaming coaching platform, EpocCam, an app that allows iPhones to serve as a webcam, and partnered with Pipeline, a course-based education platform for streamers.

Industry

**Market Size**

According to Jon Peddie Research, the global gaming and streaming gear markets is expected to reach $40B by the end of 2020. Before the pandemic JPR estimated the market to grow at a modest 1.05% CAGR until 2022. However, during 2020 the market has grown an estimated 10% year-over-year.

Additionally, DFC Intelligence research estimated that the video-game coaching market surpasses $1B.

**Industry Fundamentals**

Growth in the gaming and streaming gear industries are driven by strong and robust fundamentals.

Popularity of gaming is increasing:

According to Newzoo, there are an estimated 2.7B gamers worldwide, which are expected to spend $159B on games in 2020 and is expected to grow at an 8.3% CAGR to exceed $200B by 2023. PC and console gaming represents 51% of the total market, and mobile gaming 49%. Corsair has stated that currently there is no interest in expanding to the mobile gaming market.

Tech-driven improvements in game quality:

Advances in computer power have enabled gaming platforms to provide increasingly immersive experiences. This in turn, places increased demand on high-performance computing hardware.

Increasing gaming and streaming engagement:

Some interesting facts reported in the Limelight Networks’ State of Online Gaming 2019 research report include:

* On average, video gamers spend six hours and 20 minutes each week playing video games
* More than 38% of gamers would like to become professionals if it could support themselves
* Gamers from novice to aspiring professionals report missing daily activities due to gaming, missed sleep is the most pervasive
* Watching gamers play video games online is more popular than watching traditional sports for 18-25 year olds.

**The eSports and streaming flywheel**

The rise in popularity and viewership of eSports brings more investment from publishers, sponsors, advertisers, team owners, and leagues to the eSports industry. Increased investment brings more players and increased performance focus of gamers who advance from less engaged gaming to high-performance gameplay, which in turn brings more viewers.

Competitive Landscape & Risks

**Competition**

The gaming and streaming market is characterized by intense competition, constant price pressure and rapid change. Competition across Corsair’s product offering includes:

**Gaming keyboards and mice** \- Logitech and Razer

**Headsets and related audio products** \-Logitech, Razer, and HyperX

**Streaming gear** \- Logitech and AVerMedia

**Performance controllers** \- Microsoft and Logitech

**PSUs, cooling solutions, and computer cases** \- Cooler Master, NZXT, EVGA, Seasonic, and Thermaltake

**High performance memory** \- G.Skill, HyperX, and Micron

**Pre-built and custom-built gaming PCs** \- Alienware (Dell), Omen (HP), Asus, Razer, iBuypower and Cyberpower

**Competitive Strategy**

The company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high-performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality, high value added features, and superior brand recognition.

**Market Share**

According to NPD Group, by 2020 Corsair had #1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42% of the market share from 26% in 2015. Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders, however, the company increased its market share in that segment from 5% in 2013 to 18% by 2020 in the US.

**Growth Strategy**

Move into the Asia Pacific region:

The Asia Pacific Region represents a long-term growth opportunity. According to Newzoo, they represent 54% of the global gaming community.

Complimentary acquisitions:

Corsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming, Origin PC, SCUF and Gamer Sensei. They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position.

New Markets:

Uses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.

**Threat of New Entrants**

Because of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (e.g. use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).

**Threat of Substitution**

A significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsair’s business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.

Cloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-user’s system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.

According to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $7.2B by 2027.

Additionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.

**Moats**

There does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair’s market share across their product offering.

**Other Relevant Risks**

Due to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.

But... I've been looking at this stock for a while.  Then I saw Silver Lake Group LLC convert their $600 million of convertible notes into equity, so they obviously saw value in the stock at \~$13; That was enough for me to pick up about 1400 shares \~ $15 in January.

The short squeeze could have gone either way, so it was a bet I was willing to make.  Had it gone up to $100 due to a short squeeze I'd be happy - if it got crushed by the HF/Media/RH/Revolut and their manipulative fuckery (which is apparently where we're sitting now) then I'd still hold and grab some popcorn (Hopefully you all have realized that RH was never free, you were their product and we know who their masters are now).  Two years ago this was a $20 stock, and in the last 5 years it's had an ATH of $35.  Predictions are that we're going to see most of the vaccinations occur and a significant lifting of restrictions in time for Summer movie season - and the studios should have some decent blockbusters in the can where we see a big lift to movie theater attendance as us apes emerge from their caves where we have practically lived for 15 months, so assuming AMC stays out of bankruptcy (which is pretty likely at this point), even without a short squeeze this is a stock I can see popping back up to $20-$25 by Fall.  They still have their infrastructure, distribution, recliner seats, IMAX and dine-in options.  AMC is one of the top vendors for IMAX with a potential sector growth CAGR of 34% in 2021 because we're going to see increased customer spending and a demand for a high quality movie experience that Direct to Home (DTH) just can't match.  Lets face it, teenagers are still going to want to take their dates to dinner an a movie.

It's not flashy or as exciting as the GME spike, but long term it's still a good money making opportunity and holding long term or buying the dip still has the potential to see green by the end of the year.  

A lot of HF still have this in their scopes and you can see their short interest is still high, but this is more than just a chance to F the HFs, this is also a good value play on a stock they've been battering.

Hold the stock, buy the dip.  It's got the fundamentals to weather this storm and emerge strong post pandemic.  And added bonus you still get to F the shorts."

I know BlAcKbErRy make phones is a solid meme, but I think it is actually a very worthwhile investment regardless of the current hype (or lack thereof) around the stock.

BlackBerry Spark was launched just earlier last year and so far is winning some decent contracts. I think it has plenty of room to grow. As governments and countries start to connect more with the internet due to covid or just technology advancing cybersecurity solutions will be more relevant. I think BB has positioned itself to be a solid choice.

The United States Airforce in September selected BlackBerry Spark “for their secure productivity needs.”

They “won” the patent infringement lawsuit against Facebook, so that payout should be coming at some point. I know the stock already jumped because of the news, but still being able to uphold their patents means in the future they can sue more people for infringement and make more money.

Blackberry is out of the cell phone game which is good for them I think their software and security was really what made the phones popular to begin with so now they can focus more on that. (Also they are the largest patent holders in Canada not sure if that a really that important though)

1612317626.0,44343,WALLSTREETBETS STATE OF THE UNION,"Could you imagine two weeks ago a crusade was brewing, that several million traders would soon band together to fire one, big, shot, across the bow of some the most powerful entities in the world. How could you have? And yet here we stand in the early acts of an epic, with Hollywood fighting to tell a story that has barely begun.

Community.

Wallstreetbets has not and will never be just one individual, rather a collective of ideals and goals greater than the sum of its parts. Reddit is the soapbox that allows these diverse individuals to amplify messages that resonate with them with their votes. That does not mean this is political -- Wallstreetbets has never and will never be political.

The financial system has always been shrouded in mystery and complexity, on purpose, to keep the golden goose beneficiaries entrenched. We’ve especially seen it in action the last few weeks, where fairness and the now apparently idealistic thoughts of a level playing field have gone out the window as traders’ control of their own investments was wrested from them. We see the users, we see the quality of the content, and we’re here to evangelize on your behalf. The struggle will be long and arduous. But we’re in it if you’re in it with us. Let’s get it done you amazing degenerates.

With that, a couple of our moderators have shared their personal thoughts on Wallstreetbets and the world we find ourselves in at this juncture.

_____________________________________________________________

Thoughts from /u/zjz 

For a long time retail traders have been crabs in a bucket. Working alone with slow and limited data, crappy tools, bad execution, and worse advice. We used to be stuck listening almost solely to pre-approved narratives from people who already made it and wanted us to hold the bag. We used to be a bunch of duck-sized horses.

I don't think this is a continuation of OWS. This isn't *really* political. For our newfriends, WSB was never political. It isn't solely a battle between the rich and the poor, and it's not an attack on *the system*. It's just the next step for retail and it's obviously scary to someone. We don't need to occupy anything, this subreddit and communities like it are soon to be the 1,000lbs gorilla in the room and we're just not quite sure how to stand yet. Retail money has always loomed large, it's just never had so much information and made most of its own decisions before. It was (mis)lead by hack analysts and at best had to huddle in index funds for safety.

When we come together on platforms like this with similar goals, similar tools, and similar data, we become a force that can, even without any centralization, coordination, or deep pockets, easily destroy well-funded opponents and cause them to have to break the rules just to stay alive. Random people that have never spoken before buying GME for reasons ranging from ""haha brrr"" to 30 page writeups can cause spikes that can nearly bankrupt the kind of people that aren't used to being the ones on the losing end. They're used to being the only ones with a big stick.

This is only going to accelerate unless the other actors in this space rig the game in their favor even further **or trick us into destroying the means by which we can sit at the table**. You notice how many circuit breakers there were on the way up vs the way down? Don't accept anything that limits our access to equities, options, futures, etc. Raise hell if they try.

In order to function we need to figure out how to cram as many monkeys on as many typewriters as possible. We need to figure out how to make sure the whole sub sees what those monkeys write, we need to filter noise from signal via millions of self-interested actors. We need to figure out how we can avoid being outmaneuvered by people who will not play fair. We've got problems to solve and there will be growing pains, but we've all got a chance to be part of something that hasn't existed before. Something between a fund, a social network, a union, and an API. Work with us on improving this place and getting settled into this mode of operation instead of breaking into pieces. They'd love that. Apes apart weak.

Nobody should blame you if you love the stock or sold the stock. You should be here to make money. There will be a next time and a time after that. They can only cheat so many times before it catches up with them, they only have so many brains on the task, and we're only getting bigger.

If you’re still reading, thank you. I’m last because I’m least important. If you only skimmed the above content, fuck you. Go back and read it.

Please give all of our mods a shout out and remember to do your part by following our subreddit rules.  As a reminder: We’re all volunteers, and we do NOT accept donations. We appreciate the sentiment in wanting to donate to us, but it would be great if you donated to a charity in our name instead.  (Check out https://www.charitynavigator.org if you want suggestions)

**I’ve been here since the sub was <2000 members.** It really didn’t hit me on how crazy everything was getting until I checked Twitter last week.

Regardless of our personal political views, let’s marvel at the fact that Ted Cruz, AOC, Trump Jr, Chamath, Musk, Cuban, and countless others from various backgrounds and viewpoints agree so strongly on a single topic. We’ve had everything from fractional share owners to multi-millionaires band together because they like a stock. We’ve been in the news cycles nonstop, and there’s even tendies commercials.

Memes aside, things have been shitty for individual traders. Recent events have highlighted how skewed the game has been towards institutional traders. Whether or not there was any intentional wrongdoing, the inherent biases for a hedge fund being bailed out by another hedge fund and ALSO being a major contributor to a large portion of a brokerage’s earnings is kinda fucked up. While I’m not smart enough to say whether the game is 100% rigged, it certainly doesn’t look good. The US government breaks up monopolies for this very reason, don’t they?

The institutional investors claim we don’t know what we’re doing.  I’m just an artist myself, but there are a ton of you here, old and new, who are well-educated and actually do proper DD. 
Despite that, hedge funds continued to freely trade while retail traders were locked out. We’re showing them we can make decisions with our own finances, but institutions don’t like that. They enact laws and force emergency actions to “protect” us when the reality is that it limits our ability to compete **fairly**. Can someone explain to me how Pattern Day Trading protects the retail investor? Can someone explain to me why an individual must have > $1m in assets to be an accredited investor? 

There’s an opportunity in front of us -- We have a chance to make a difference and maybe level the playing field. There are government hearings on Feb 18th, and we have politicians from ALL sides offering to look into what happened. **We even have billionaires like Mark Cuban and the Winklevoss Twins speaking out against this unfairness.** Regardless of what happens, I’m just thankful that I got to be here from the start. Our jungle may be bigger, but it’s been the same bananas the whole time.

So what now? We have an opportunity to change the game. We need to move away from a system with power in the hands of the few to one where power is in the hands of the many. The alternative is that we stay where we are now, where the fate of retail traders is at the whim of archaic institutions. Where they can arbitrarily halt stocks and shackle the free market.  Why can I Cashapp someone for feet pics in *seconds*, but it takes TWO WHOLE DAYS for shares to be delivered from the DTCC?  Why do they also get to choose what the deposit requirements are? Something needs to change, and I’m certain we’re not limited by the technology. We’re limited by the people."

1612317584.0,180,"VW 2008, GME and you Autists","Alright you Apes listen. Gotta combat some of this shit.

I keep seeing so many posts around here about this squeeze and that the 2008 VW squeeze are totally the same. Or that in 2008 the VW squeeze happened with a much smaller short position. 

They are not the same full stop and the VW squeeze didn't have a smaller short position.

First and foremost I'm holding 9 shares at an avg cost of $352.00 I'm still in it but all the shit DD needs to stop. 

Sorry if this hurts your feelings.

So first and foremost just because they are both short squeezes does not mean they are going to behave the same. Part of the reason for this is the suprise and speed at which the VW squeeze happened to funds.

Second and the main part of this post. The short position was not actually smaller in VW. I'll explain. 

In 2008 the VW short squeeze happened causing VW to become the most valued company on the entire NYSE. The reason for this situation is similar to the current situation there were more shorts out than shares to cover. 

Now I already hear your stupid screeching ""BUT IS WAS ONLY 12 PERCENT SHORT!!!""

Now I'm sure you had to kick off your shoes and socks to count that high and really I'm proud but here is the whole story.

Porsche had quietly bought nearly 75% of the company. This was done in a few sneaky ways but ultimately that's what happened.

Now before this there were only 45% of the shares available anyways due to Porsche having an existing 30% stake various index funds 5% and finally 20% covered by the german government.

To break it down 30+20+5 = 55% already owned. and 13 percent or so short.

Now let's add in Porsche's new stake 75+20+5=95%

And since these shares are now bought by people who have no interest or in some cases no ability to sell we there is a 13% short position on only about 5% of trading shares.

The final catalist was VW issuing a statement to the shorts letting them know they were super duper fucked. Like you forgot to pick up your wife's birth control and now your rasing her boyfriends son levels of fucked.

This caused the short squeeze from hell.

Now as to our current dilemma. Nothing is guaranteed to behave the same however if the shorts have not closed their positions sufficiently this might happen again. So good news for we big dick diamond hand fuckers if that is the case. But anyone who this is your first time at this shit know that you might be about to learn a painful fucking lesson that just because 2 similar things happen it doesn't mean shit.

1612317209.0,469,"Plans from here on, we have many options.","Fellow Degenerates, happy day to you all, or not considering we got ripped 2 new assholes today. 

Anyway, besides that fact I want to get some insight on what your plans for the next few days are? 

First let me start off by saying that I have not sold a single share of GME OR AMC. I am holding both. But I did have 55x $5 calls for AMC that I sold on expiration day (Jan 29th) which netted me a very healthy profit. 

I feel as if the true squeeze has not yet even begun. In the back of my mind I have this crazy theory that the market makers and hedge funds deliberately and illegally drove the price down for one main reason. They now want to be apart of the squeeze as well. 

I mean from a financial standpoint why would they not want to make thousands of % of gains? When instead they can only make 100% when they short. 

They are starting to realize the true power behind this movement, they know that it is not going to be easily stopped and the main squeeze is inevitable.

Now what do bagholders do? Well frankly you have 2 options here. Option #1 is, continue to hold your bags patiently and wait until the moon. Option #2 continue to hold your bags and wait until we land on fucking Pluto 

Now there is also a option #3 and that option is to close your position and take whatever money you have left and run. This option sucks donkey ducks. And in turn will probably cause you life long depression when and if we squeeze to astronomical heights. 

Now, I say this with a heavy heart, but if you sold.... Your a bitch. If you feel stupid for buying in, then you probably are. We all know what the risks are. Who buys a stock that goes from $2 to $500 in a matter of days and then wonders why it dropped? You, you bitch. Do not be clueless, do not let this demotivate you. You don’t lose until you sell. You still have your shares. Doesn’t matter what you paid for them at this point because if you bought at $500 you 10000% were not planning on selling at $525 or even $575. So nothing here has changed. Wait until the real squeeze. 

And if all else fails, well you can look back and say you were apart of history. Not that anyone is gonna give a fuck. Anyways fuck you all. Thank you. And so long! Much love!! ❤️"

1612316846.0,214,"$GME, what comes next?","Let's establish the main opinion behind what I am going to type - GME  will not become bankrupt in the short term. If you believe GME will go  bankrupt within the next few months, then my thesis is completely  broken.

The shortsellers were betting on bankruptcy. That's why they dared to  short GME >100%. If GME went bankrupt, they would get more money than  what GME was initially worth.

That's literally printing money out of thin air. But it absolutely  requires GME to become bankrupt, so that the extra shorted shares will  never ever have to be bought back.

Now, if we can agree GME won't go bankrupt at this point. So what happens next?

When the share price drops, 3 things happen:

1. paper handers sell
2. diamond handers buy
3. short sellers must cover

As prices drop, #1 will get fewer as they sell. Since share price won't  go to 0, #3 will want to cover at the dip as much as possible. #2 will  buy in massively. At this stage, liquidity evaporates. What happens  then? MOASS.

This is why you see the drop in VW's short squeeze graph right before their squeeze. The trigger for the squeeze is Porsche announcing its big dick stake, which immediately made everyone realize that VW stock is no longer liquid.

&#x200B;

Alternatively, we might see a $TSLA like slow squeeze, as earning numbers come in and short close out slowly 1 by 1 from the bottom up. For this, we will need to trust Papa Cohen. ❤️

1612316775.0,127,A theory on hedges and a possible squeeze.,"One theory I have been batting around my head. 

Due to the massive losses to the hedges. Why wouldn’t a couple of hedges. Once they have covered. Start massively going long in order to start a massive squeeze to get rid of all the other hedges that are still short. (Still a large short interest) It would only take a small push I think from some big hedges to kickstart the perpetual upward rise.  Retail would join in. The whales are already in.  They would then bail when the squeeze is sqoze and their competition is gone. 

Why would they do this. 
1. It gets rid of the competition 
2. It minimises their losses from the previous shorts. If done right it could actually make them profit. 

Why wouldn’t they do this
1. It would make retail think they won and were right.  Cant have the little guy declaring victory. Is pride more important than money to these despicable miscreants. 

If this is correct then those holding could be rewarded by the hedges.  It would also explain why there was $25m in $800 3/19 calls.

If any of you autists actually did some DD or even watched some of DFV's videos, you'll realize that GME was a value play, *the short squeeze was just the cherry on top*. I have seen over the past two weeks, a huge gaslighting effort from billionaires on TV (and unintentionally reddit users pushing only the MOASS), getting you to believe that Gamestop's value is from the short squeeze. What everyone forgot is how valuable of a company Gamestop is now.

**So what changed about Gamestop?**

In Nov 2020 Ryan fking Cohen joined Gamestop's Board. Who is Ryan Cohen? This is the guy who built Chewy from the ground up, he was in all respects, able to build a Pet e-commerce empire and directly compete with **Amazon**. Not only did Ryan join the board, but he was able to bring along with him Chewy's COO/CMO and CFO. You know who else is on the board? Reggie Fils-Aimé, the previous President of Nintendo Americas. If you don't know Reggie, you definitely know his face. So now you know Gamestop is poised for a shakeup, Ryan didn't join the Board and bring with him two other people because he thought Gamestop was going to get squozed, he did it because he understands there is a lot of money to be made here.

**Valuation**

I'm not going to pretend I'm an expert in valuing companies. Properly evaluating a company purely based on financials does not work in today's market anymore, but to appease the F people.

Here are some facts:

Critics argue brick and mortar retail, and as a result Gamestop, is dying. While they aren't wrong, they fail to also address that Gamestop had **300% YoY growth in e-commerce sales**. Gamestop is also actively shutting down stores and rebranding existing ones as experience centers. Physical Gamestop stores are going to be where all you autists hang out when you're outside of your rooms.

Gaming is huge, anyone who argues otherwise is living under a rock. As cringe as it was, Ninja hosting the NYC ball drop is testament to this. Singular game titles like Fortnite and Minecraft are worth billions alone. The gaming industry itself is worth nearly **$200 Billion** and slated to grow double digits YoY.

[There is a great DD written by a VC on why Gamestop is going to the moon](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/)

>This market cap (matching industry standards) should for an appropriate valuation for a growth stock be $50B.....This is why the short squeeze is distracting many. In 5 years if you diamond hands this company, the fair value of shares can range from $800-$2400 and not be in any sort of bubble or unjustified by fundamentals speculation.

To repeat that, based on fundamentals alone (nothing to do with a short squeeze), GME per share could be worth $800 conservatively, or $50 Billion. Chewy at this time is worth roughly $40 Billion in a smaller market, Pet products vs Gaming.

So polish your paper hands and turn them into fking diamonds. There is nothing Wall St can do can make you sell. And when this company starts turning itself around, you'll have been at the ground floor. 

**TL:DR Gamestop not worth nothing if shorts not squoze. Everyone wants you to believe it so you can sell now. Gaming is huge, Gamestop is positioning itself to be big.** 

P.S. For all you retards, everyday you hold your shares is another day Melvin and co need to pay interest. Hold your stocks for at least a year, and you even get to pay long term capital gains tax as opposed to short term counts as ordinary income. (Read hold onto your shares for longer, less booboo from govt). Also this is why you don't fking buy on margin or play with options."

1612315788.0,120,The GME Short Squeeze & PLTR Black Friday (for new apes only),"Gather round retards and let me tell you the story of Palantir Black Friday and how sentiments then mirror sentiments now with the massive GME dip.

In the days leading up to Black Friday, PLTR was ripping, easily projecting to break the $40s. But what happened you say? Yes, Thanksgiving happened and although momentum did not actually slow down, sentiments did. People realized how much tendies they were getting and decided to take profit. Yes we all know that shitron and the subsequent downgrades were the primary catalysts for PLTR’s dip and its month long sideways trade. But the profit taking due to a day of market closure realized while eating turkey with family was a secondary reason.

Everyone believed that the weekend after Black Friday would cool negative sentiment and it was just a minor dip but boy were we wrong. That baby dropped to $22.

After that, PLTR traded sideways for all of December, setting itself up for nice wedges but never happened. Thousands of accounts were wiped.

How does this relate to you and the GME squeeze?

The weekend happened. Everyone thought this was the week of reckoning, but it wasn’t...so far. Just because the hive mind here thinks something will happen and even if all the TA points to a breakout, that doesn’t mean it will and in fact, the opposite can happen. Like the other posts have said, the market does not care if all of your stars aligned and certainly will not move to confirm your biases. There is no defined time limit for how long the hedges can last and they can most likely outlast you unless you play your cards correctly.

With that being said, I DO believe the squeeze is yet to come with the stipulation that we collectively hold.

TLDR: Know your risk tolerance, listen to the apes here...if you dare. Hold GME till we bankrupt the hedges."
1612315770.0,191,Cohen still has the opportunity to buy another 7%. Seems like a great price to do so.,"A while back I read a [VERY good DD Post](https://redd.it/l0czgs) by u/FatAspirations talking about how big of a player Cohen truly is in all of this. Given the massive red days we've seen twice this week I'd really recommend giving it a read. But the one point that's important, and point of this post is:

* Cohen still has a contract to buy another 7% of GME Shares

He currently owns around 13%, and is restricted to owning no more than 20% as part of an agreement. Obviously he wouldn't want to exercise that right when the price is $350, and he has until the end of 2022 to do it, but if he thinks $100 is the new Floor, or around there, wouldn't this be the best time for him to do so?

Every single one of his share purchases in the past have been about sending a message. Why not this one too?

Edit: 7% would equate to about 5M shares of a 70M Float, if my maffs right. But am retard.

1612315697.0,1110,GME's Data irregularities,"Today, I found another irregularity in GME's data. When I looked at the position-cost distribution chart for GME after today's close, I was expecting it to be very different compared to yesterday's chart, since assuming paper hands have sold, they would change this distribution significantly (and today's volume SEEMED to be high). However, I found something fascinating: today's chart was a super-set of yesterday's chart! In other words, it looks like some shares were added to the float and it looks like almost none of the previous shares has moved (diamond hands goes here)!

Take a look:

[Position cost distribution comparison between 2\/1\/21 and 2\/2\/21](https://i.redd.it/33hacgf7p5f61.gif)

Webull's description of what this chart represents is the following:

[Source: Webull](https://preview.redd.it/1s38i8iyp5f61.jpg?width=1061&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8284c1f5a164eb17d77b32a28ffccee8bf79ad42)

If I'm reading this correctly, this means two things:

1. It looks like all the shares that were traded today were new and added to the float!
2. People actually seem to be diamond handing!

I can see four possible explanations for the new shares (add a comment if you see other possibilities):

1. GameStop offered shares: this didn't happen as far as I know!
2. An institution that had shares that weren't in the float sold his shares: I can't find any filings, especially with this many shares, but there could be a delay
3. Short sellers borrowed shares that were not in the float (which probably were covered and returned before) and shorted them again.
4. Naked shorting!

The reason why I think 1 and 2 are unlikely is that almost all of the sell orders I saw today were trying to bring the price down, so an insider or an institution that is not short probably wasn't the one selling (they are also probably in a blackout period, but I'm not sure)!

I think 3 is more likely than 4, so I think someone was shorting the shit out of GME today, increasing the short interest considerably.

But here's the thing: at the end of the day, these new shares seem to be not that many, and the same chart seem to be showing that all of the previous shares are already locked, I think these shares will be locked in a few days/hours as well (if they haven't been locked already). So this somewhat guarantees a close to infinity short interest. Furthermore, given that all of these shares were shorted at a relatively low price, so I believe that whoever did (is doing) this, is just digging his own grave! I'm not sure if this continues or not (depends on how many shares they can borrow from institutions), but it made me feel better to see people don't seem to be paper handing that much!

PS. I wish Webull would put a proper X-axis on this chart, that would be very useful!

PS2. To SEC/Government agencies: It seems like you don't care about the retail investors, but let me give you another incentive: if you don't stop these short-selling morons from blowing themselves up over and over again, I think you might end up having a legitimate market crash/financial crisis on your hands! It doesn't matter how much money these folks have, since these guys are at mercy of the shareholders: the supply of shares is EXTREMELY low and the demand is EXTREMELY high (even though the brokerages have artificially reduced the demand for now). From what I'm seeing on this sub (and from the data), people don't seem to have plans to sell below $1k-$10k per share (I wouldn't be surprised if that moves up to $50k-$100k per share if GME SP reaches $1k-$10k), do the math yourselves!

 **Disclaimer: I'm not a financial adviser and the content of this post is not financial advice. This is for entertainment purposes only and purely speculative even though it might look otherwise! I've been long GME and have a lot of GME shares. I also added a few weekly calls today!**

EDIT:
tldr;
It seems like today:

EDIT2:
Someone said there is another possible explanation: call writers might have dumped their shares if last week’s expired calls were canceled (if they hedged them earlier).

That's fucking AWESOME that DFV is still in and is holding with his diamond dong, but first things first, he cashed out $13M along the way and has been very transparent on this. What's losing $20M if you're up $40M? 

&#x200B;

DFV is why a lot of retail investors entered the market. DFV never intended for this to hit as high as it did and that's apparent in his positions, he thought GME was heavily shorted and had a lot of potential, but there's no way he thought it would lead to short squeeze 1k+ territory. 

HE IS NOT THE NUMBERS BEHIND THIS AND ""I"" NEED TO THINK FOR MYSELF

""I"" need to stop making him a martyr for this sub for the day he eventually sells. The SEC is probably watching him like a hawk and I'm assuming that's a big reason that he's still in even though it's in his long play.

1612315119.0,779,Financial advice for people who just joined WSB from a degenerate veteran,"**TLDR : Only invest with WSB what you're willing to lose.** 

Recently, there's been a huge influx of people who joined WSB in hopes of making millions of dollars and buying Lamborghinis. I'm here to give you some boring ass boomer advice : WSB is less of an investing subreddit and more of a gambling one. *Sir, this is a casino.* I mean, it's in the name, right? WallStreet **BETS**

Over the last few years that I've been a member, I've seen a lot of people YOLO their life savings on SPY calls and puts and lose bigly. These people are WSB legends, but are also actual retards. 

However, I'd say that a significant percentage of us are *smart* investors. By that I mean that we are financially responsible enough to know not to put all of our life savings into Gourds.

I don't have a financial background, so take what I say with a grain of salt, but I've been a member of personalfinance and financialindependence subreddits for a while before joining WSB. I'm not asking you to be a degenerate autist and put your money on boomer ass dividend stocks and jerk off over making $2 on dividends a year, but to be a *little* bit more responsible with your money. By that, I mean the following : 

* If you have student loans, try paying back your student loans ASAP since those will fuck with you the most. If you are broke ass shit, and jacked to tits in 200k loans, the last thing you want to do is to take out more loans to gamble on memestonks. See what your minimum payments are and try to hit those and if you have money leftover, you can use that to fuck around with.  
* Save 3 months of rent and food (depending on where you live, I'd say about $3000) in an emergency savings account (or some boomer low-risk ETF like VOO). Do this because if you lose ALL your money, where the fuck are you going to stay and eat? 
* Before throwing all your money in Robinhood, put some in your ROTH IRA since the taxman won't take away a lot of your gains. 
* If you do make hella gains on some YOLO option on Robinhood, save like 20% or whatever that short-term capital gain amount is for the taxman or he'll come back to bite you in the ass. 
* Once you have some emergency cash stored (or are willing to live with your parents), and have made some minimal contributions to your ROTH IRA, aren't swimming in credit card and student loans and can make your minimum payments , you are now ready to be a WSB degenerate.

This isn't an investing subreddit. A lot of us play with money which we are okay with losing. Although, I've made **a LOT more** on RH than I have on the measly 10% yearly gains with my ROTH IRA and 401K, it's nice to see that on red days when the market is drilling into the earth's asshole and all my weeklies will expire worthless, I still haven't lost as much in my other boomer accounts. 

Once you feel like you're in a comfortable enough place in life where your only source of income is NOT your weekly SPY calls, you are now ready to be a WSB degenerate like us. Start off testing the waters by buying a few shares of some of the most mentioned tickers here without doing any DD since **we can't read** and lose some money on shitty stocks $PLTR and $MT.  (Edit: relax fellow palantards, this is a joke. I, too, am a ~~bagholder~~ believer) 

Once you feel like you understand the little intricacies of the market (Bad earnings == stonk fall, good earnings == stonks go up but maybe could go down also, Biden president meaning WEED and CLEAN ENERGY go UP), you can now invest invest in options. 

*Optional : Buy a cheap $0.1 option that is way over the money to understand how options work, what theta decay is, etc*

I like to think of RH as playing roulette, where I just toss a bunch of $$ on hype stocks and hope for the best, but you could also make some safe bets depending on your risk tolerance and actually try to do some DD yourself, but we don't do that here. 

In the late 2020 tech ""crash"" I lost over $5000 on dumb ass tech calls, but it didn't really affect me that much since it was my ""play money"" and *you win some you lose some*. If that money actually meant a lot to me, I'd have been super fucked. So yeah, if you were to get ONE thing out of this post:

**Only ""invest"" with WSB what you're willing to lose.** 

Here's some other lessons I've learned over the years : 

* Don't give stock tips to ANYONE, especially family. (Learned that the hard way, read my previous post) 

* If you're going full retard and investing in penny stocks, stop-loss is your friend. 

Having said that, welcome to WSB.

This brings me to my second point of using your resources. Take the military for example, do you fire your weapon nonstop hoping you hit your target? Don't think so. Does the fact that you have a few million bros with you change that fact? It shouldn't. You have to be decisive and calculated with your ammo, and you definitely do not waste it unless you are absolutely sure it will help your cause.   

No one here, on twitter, Wall St, or even Mark Cuban really cares how many shares you have.  Seriously, when the dust settles, no one cares. Imagine the wealth of knowledge and information you can obtain with 5k. The courses, tools, and trading platform upgrades you can get with 10k. There is so much you can ACTUALLY do with your money to help you understand this system and help you appreciate it what it can do for you long term. **I promise you the HFs have invested millions into research, education and data analysis before they YOLO into anything. Why won't you do the same for yourself?**

**So please, don't keep tossing your money into a depreciating proposition backed by principles just so you can blame someone who has no fiduciary duty to care about you.** It will only cripple you and your mentality. A million jokers running into a casino with millions of dollars is not going to beat the house. They will only feed it.  A few well-trained card counters with a thousand bucks, who fully understand the system, just might.  So be honest with yourself."

1612314774.0,1316,Diamond Hands Listen Up! GME is on sale right now and will be going to the moon THIS week. The hedges played us so hard that they have played themselves.,"\*\*TDLR at the bottom\*\*

First off, to all of you diamond handing this stock, god damn I love you apes.

Now listen up and listen closely. GME is still on a moon mission and its launch is imminent. I've seen some fantastic DD here that is far beyond my analytical skills and I thank you all for that because god knows I can't read so the charts help.

This break down is going to be consist of something we tend to lack here, and that my friends, is logic.

So lets get into it. 

This past week has seen GME hit an ATH followed by a steep decline due to market manipulation tactics and the media turning against us at presumably the hand of the hedge funds we stand to hurt the most. We have seen hit pieces on GME, misdirection, and blatant lies regarding the analytics and reporting of statistics on GME. Countless media outlets have claimed that GME has squeezed already and its over! Its done! Move on and move back in with your wife's boyfriend!

But they are wrong.

Think of this from a surface level and look at the big picture. This entire week was a setup for shorts to mitigate their losses which they knew they would incur regardless. First, we saw a price spike that opened up options far, far OTM.  Out to 800 fucking dollar calls. Then, we saw a steep decline in price along with a fundraiser for shorts in the form of SLV being pushed by shills. Following this we saw massive purchases of these OTM 800c yesterday once premiums and IV were reduced. So what does this mean? Hedges set themselves up to mitigate how much they'll lose in hopes of just avoiding bankruptcy while giving their associates a chance to profit even greater on the impending squeeze. 

Now why would it come this week if a lot of the calls are dated out to March you ask? Apparently, and I don't know this for fact, but Fintel will update GME's short interest officially as of next Tuesday, February 9th. If this is true, and short interest is still over 100%, this will confirm that media outlets were bought and paid for by hedges along with their misdirection, thus causing even further public outrage, and another mass buying of GME to get in on the squeeze that is still coming. 

However, if hedges knock the price down as far as possible and trigger the squeeze this week, they will have effectively hedged their bets with calls, shaken out as many paper hands as possible, and stopped delaying the inevitable, all while leaving the media outlets they paid off, now holding the metaphorical bag of lost public trust, all while mitigating their losses to the fullest extent. 

Essentially, if the short interest is still outstanding and above 100%, shorts would fuck themselves even further by allowing an official report of this to come out and they know it. 

We go the moon soon my fellow apes. Good luck and God speed. See you at 10,000.

This is NOT financial advice and I AM and APE.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Hedges have mitigated their losses and have screwed buyers and the media outlets they've bought. When official short interest reports come out, they'll be outed as liars and the retail retaliation will send us even further to the moon than if they just let it happen prior to these reports."

1612314659.0,45,Check out this loss porn. They are here. They are among us. We will not be stopped!!! I don’t hear no bell kids!,
1612314599.0,4572,Where are my fellow diamond hands? Down over 2 mil from GME's peak last week. Still holding and adding to my position.,
1612314589.0,54,Lost a Total of 14 but DIAMOND HANDS💎🙌🚀,
1612314581.0,261,I think the HF's are leaving the writers of the 800c 2/5 options as the bag holders.,"Imagine you are an HF that shorted this stock to oblivion, and a bunch of retards come into a long position raising the price by 1000%. The interest rate on your shorts goes through the roof and you are about to go bankrupt. What do you do? First you up your fire power by bringing in funds. Then you vilify your enemies, telling the world that they are the problem, not you. Then you stop the squeeze by putting a throttle on demand side. Then you divert the money to side show securities that will actually raise your bottom line.  


What next? You still have to pay back the shares. You are not going to get it cheap. How do we limit it? I could buy cheap way OTM call options knowing that when we start to cover, the price is going to explode because the diamond handed apes won't be selling for cheap. How do you maximize this? 

1) you need a cheap OTM call. Since 2 weeks ago, the highest call was 160, and last week was 320, they weren't far enough out of the money to be cheap. 

2) to make it cheaper, you need it to look like the squeeze has squoze, and gain as many shares from paper hands on the way down. Lowering the price per share on the call options. 

3) purchase enough OTM calls to cover your short position after it explodes. Locking in your price to cover at 800 per share max.   


Proof:   
[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options/)  
Here we can see that there is a volume of 28,493 call options purchased. Holy shit...

That is 2.85 million shares. 2.28 Billion dollars worth at that strike price. 

With the volume of trades as it rises to that point, plus the volume of those calls, they could bring their short positions low enough to complete the squeeze.  


Who is left holding the bag? HF will mostly hold the bag. Seeing as they will be paying 2.28 Billion dollars at least. Then the real bag holders will be the writers of the call options. They will have to purchase the shares raising the price above 800 due to a gamma squeeze. 

TL;DR: I believe hedge funds have gotten rid of their risk of having to pay the 10k per share we think is reasonable to a max of 800 by purchasing way out of the money calls, and writers of call options will be the biggest bag holders in history.   


Guys I'm just a retard that has never professionally traded, I don't know shit about shit. I'm holding on to my stocks, and they will have to pry them out of my cold dead diamond hands. Don't listen to this. It's not financial advice.

Then open WSB, see retards crying, complaining, and saying this is end of the squeeze.

 No. No it is not. GME just went on sale, steam spring sale, buy one get one free, store wide discount, whatever the heck you want, they knew that some of us didn't have the money to pay +$200 for 1 stock, so they came down to refuel and pick up others so they don't have to be lonely. Once everyone is on board, to the moon we go to repopulate with the wives/gf/daughters of paperhands. Reaching prices above $500 and then to infinity and beyond.

Like it or not in general people are bearish on the stock and the fact that 100P is now pretty deep ITM doesn't bode well for the stock. What we are experiencing is pretty much a gamma squeeze but downwards. 

That halt today was pretty bullshit because we were on the way up above 100  and an IV crush on OTM $100 puts would've given us some momentum upward. But no it just had to happen on the way up. 

Anyways this week looks pretty bearish and it is possible we could dump some more if we don't take back 100. I've been wrong before and I hope I'm wrong again. Keep diamond handing though, MM has been fucking with us by jacking up the price of options to make it harder for us to buy and profit from this. They can't do this forever and in fact, I've been profiting by selling OTM puts at great prices while holding onto my shares, I know theta gang isn't welcome here but what could be better than getting paid to hold gme at discount prices? or selling puts to expire worthless to GME bears?

1612314193.0,181,"DD on Delta Airlines, Calls for Jan 2022","  

Listen up retards,

Many of you are probably looking for a new direction from which tendies may fly. Well do I have a solution for you. It’s a big reverse course from the boomer dinner this sub ate over the past few weeks.

Yes my friends, I propose aggressive call options/long positions on the Airline industry, specifically Delta. Here’s why:

Past:

\- Going back to a report by Forbes, [Delta ranks best](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurabegleybloom/2020/07/27/covid-report-best-worst-airlines-coronavirus/?sh=48b3b5ff13af) in terms of cleanliness during COVID, meaning prevailing sentiment among travelers is high right now.

Present:

\- Delta is the [last major airline not filling middle seats](https://news.delta.com/delta-only-us-airline-block-middle-seats-limit-onboard-capacity-through-march-30-2021#:~:text=Delta%20will%20continue%20delivering%20on,now%20through%20March%2030%2C%202021), thereby spacing passengers out. 

\- This is good because, again it improves customer safety/feeling of safety during flights

\- This also means that they have been seating fewer passengers throughout the pandemic, while total profits have remained largely equal with their major competitors

\- Tighter self-imposed restrictions may mean fewer international restrictions, but this is more speculative than anything

Future:

\- Expects to hit profitability by July

\- Pandemic expense cuts to older aircraft should present a $400m decrease to annual costs, even when considering a ramp up in overhead as traffic increases

\- Delta expects at least 70% of their large corporate clients to return by the end of the year

Those final 2 points are from their last earning call, which means… well of course theyd be bullish on themselves, but if its to be believed, then Delta is ready to come out of the pandemic strong. With a mix of leisure travel skyrocketing, business travel returning to some extent, and the holidays leading to a traffic spike right in time for Jan 2022 calls, I’m thinking of going hog deep in 65c at $1.61 a piece.

My main price suppressing factor is that [children aren't expected to receive the COVID Vaccine](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/children-coronavirus-vaccine-late-2021-experts/story?id=73364817) until late 2021. If children can’t get the vaccine then families cannot travel. I'm banking a lot here on the vast majority of Americans getting the vaccine in time for Christmas. As a result my theory leads me to the Jan 2022 options, rather than the Sep ones, as the holiday rush will play out before they expire.

TLDR:

Plane no fly good now, but stock not so bad. When plane fly more, stock more better."

1612314065.0,0,HOW TO TAKE THEM DOWN ONCE AND FOR ALL IN ONE DAY! 🚀💎,"Retards listen up. Send instructions to your wall street blood subrokerage firm to mail your Gme certificates to your shitty homes. If they do not comply within 3 days, ask to speak to their compliance department  and they will do it. Next order a game from your local game stop store. When you get the certificates guard them with your life because they will be worth allot.  

Here are the steps for u idiots:

1. Send instructions to your brokerage firm to mail out GME certificates to your home 

2. Sell covered calls slightly higher than the market price for your AMC, BB or any other stonk you own 

3. Use the income from the covered calls to buy more GME stock, if you like the stock and have those sent home. 

4. Order a game from game stop before the end of the day, because they sell great games. Get someone to help you with the math if you can't figure out what happens next. Real diamond hands sleep with their certificates under their pillow. 

This would crush the brokerage firm and the hedge funds. IN ONE DAY!!

EDIT: they borrowed your stock to short. They have to buy if hold your certificates. Idiots."

May be just maybe let the basic system of a free market work and let supply and demand find a price without restricting the one or the other. You don’t need a degree in Economics to tell that the price go down if you cripple the whole bid-side.

Or May be don’t halt the stock 50 times on the way up while you only halted a few times when it does the same movement it’s way down. 


Now the boomer media coming after this fraudulent activities with „we told you so“ and blaming the „Reddit investors“ for the plunge and stating that their loss their interest and are selling now. When dump shorter shorts more than 100% of the available free float and are not willing to pay the price, then the side of the trade is evil and dump for doing a rational good trade? 

Fuck this free market. It’s only a free market as long they win. If they start to lose in this Game they change the rules, the referee choosing their side, and the camera man on the field doesn’t Films the fouls of them. Instead they showing the innocent as evil and „Must be punished“ type of folks

1612313872.0,96,GME strategy for diamond hands who bought at peak,"Hello apes,

Inspired by Marc Cuban who said to hold long term, here is a quick calculator for you on how much dip you need to buy to end up in the green long term:

S1 = current average purchase price
S2 = dip price
ST = target average price
NC = current number of shares
X = number of shares to buy

(S1*NC + S2*X) /(NC + X) = ST

X = (S1*NC - NC*ST) / (ST - S2)

Cost to pay: X*S2

__________________________
Example:

Current 10 shares at 200$ 
Assuming GME dropped to 1$
Target average price of 2$

X = ( 200*10 - 2*10)/(2-1)= 1980 shares

Cost to pay: 1980*1= 1980$

New position: 1990 shares @ 2$
Total investment: 3990$
_________________________

Now wait for GME to tick from 2$ to 3$ and you are in the green

Have fun

Remove emotion from this if you can. I recommend /r/Stoicism. There are posts there already addressing this situation.

The Shorts are simply preparing (unsure if it's all legal but whatever, I'm trying not to visualise them as human as much as they are simply the other side of the equation. Also, punitive damages at this stage is still a drop in the ocean compared to handling this situation as best as fiscally possible.  They know their pushing the law too and it should be good news for a Long position to see this. If you've ever been through a legal process, you know when the other side is pulling out ridiculous shit that they reek of desperation).

The deeper we get into their play book, the better. 

The key battles were igniting this whole thing, which we did, and the other one last Friday to get those calls ITM, which we did. This past Monday and Tuesday is not as important mathematically as those key events. Sure, $360->$90 looks like a win, and in some ways it really is a win for the shorts. Just like how the Longs have notched a few good battles too. I mean no shit, they're a pretty good opponent, right?! 

**tl;dr: The other side is preparing as best they can. What else would you expect? Remove your emotions.  The other side is in damage control. Unless you seriously expect them to get this to zero, why wouldn't you hold? The more legal lines they cross, the better.

1612313475.0,1586,The Truth about the State of the Sub,"Ok guys, I’m happy about what has happened with GME, and the rest of the BANG stonks, honestly. It’s inspired a real look into the inner workings of the markets, and fucked over some hedge funds who were more likely than not doing shady things. If any legal victories come of this, whether they create limits on shorting to be under 100% of float, or not allowing market makers to double dip, whatever it is, there may actually be something positive that comes from this on that front. 

That being said - this isn’t only a GME sub, and I’m not here for a fucking cause, to make some political statement, or cry about manipulation all day. You know why a lot of the original people joined this sub years ago? It was to make fuckin money! Share non conventional ideas, go balls deep on some wild plays, YOLO on earnings, share the memes, win or lose with my retarded brothers in arms. If you made money on GME and rode the wave then I’m genuinely happy for you. If you use a real broker and shorted GME at 420 because that’s how you were going to make your fucking tendies, I’m also happy for you. We’re losing our luster and anything else that’s not GME and co is getting downvoted to shit or drowned out. 

You know what this sub isn’t about? The information echo chamber and hive mind bullshit that pervades the rest of Reddit. I actually hated Reddit and made an account years ago but really only got into it because of this sub. You post some conspiracy theory bullshit about how every institution is conspiring to ruin the retail traders because GME is down today? Fuck you, you’re a fucking idiot because the reality is more institutions actually made money off of this rocketing up than lost by shorting against it. Who did we hurt? 3 hedge funds? Fuck guys come on. You know how much big money was behind this move too? It’s just as plausible that all the bots people are worried about are actually from longs, convincing everyone to stay in so institutions can unload the bags onto retail. In fact, it’s actually more likely because like I said, there are more of them on our side who rode the wave up, than the 3 we hurt by it going up. Ever fucking think of that? 

I expect better, and there’s nothing wrong with having more people in the sub as someone who’s been here since like 300k. But you gotta actually cut the shit and put real effort into some of these posts, and know that it’s not about conspiring against the world of institutional investing. It’s about making fucking money - that’s it. 

Wanna know what the best thing about the investment world is? If you don’t like a fucking trade, you can take the other side of it, or you can not play it at all! We used to have people that bet against each other on the reg, and you know what’s beautiful about that dynamic? We shared our losses and our victories and owned up to it, together. It wasn’t a conspiracy sub, it was a sub of autists who won and lost together, even if they were on different sides, with the end goal of get rich or die trying. You would all learn from looking at the history of the sub and some of the quality we used to have. Please, for the sake of keeping this an actually good community, chill the fuck out.

With inexperience come a lot of psychological phallacies that Funds are exploiting:

# BUY LOW SELL HIGH.

*The. Core. Principal. Of. Trading.*

You never, ever sell when down. You don't. If you sell at loss you're literally **BUYING HIGH AND SELLING LOW!!!** If you don't 100% NEED this money RIGHT FUCKING NOW. Do. Not. Sell. It would be more entertaining literally burning money then selling at artificially low prices. NO ONE IS FORCING YOU TO SELL. If you're getting nervous about LOSSES ----> DONT LOOK AT THE STOCK. DELETE YOUR APP. DO NOT GET STRESSED AND EMOTIONAL. You are not acting rationally when emotions get involved in trading. NEVER SELL EMOTIONALLY. Emotions are your enemy in trading and you WILL LOSE MONEY. If you're emotionally attached to your invested money, try avoiding any further trades until you're set up where you can (emergency fund, tax advantaged accounts etc. can help you feeling more secure).

It's negative today, it may be negative tomorrow. The DD still stands. GME as a company is in the spotlight of the world. It has a future.

Even if there will be no short squeeze. DO NOT SELL AT LOSS. WAIT. 1 year, 3 years, 10 years. WHATEVER. It can get green again. IT CAN AND IT MAY. If you sell at loss, it wont.

I KNOW THIS IS NO TYPICAL WSB (NON) ADVICE, BUT WITH SO MANY FUCKING RETARDS JUMPING IN WITH NO FUCKING CLUE WHAT THEIR DOING IT NEEDS TO BE SAID.

Some more autistic shit

# Percieved Value:

Remember when you bought your shares. Let's say you bought at $300. You made the decision that this stock, its potential and emotional value, is worth $300 to you and you bought.

Now the Price is artificially driven down. The beginning value hasn't changed. No one says that stock is worth less, unless you do. Unless you yourself decide that you're willing to sell at a lower price.

When selling at $100 -> YOU ARE SAYING IT'S WORTH THIS LITTLE. YOU DECIDE AT WHAT PRICE YOU'RE WILLING TO SELL. If you don't WANT to sell at $100 WAIT TILL YOU CAN SELL IT TO FUCKING MELVIN AT $6000.

Plus: Loss Aversion

A loss of 10% is emotionally more powerfull than a gain of 10%. They are preying on this effect to bring you to make an emotional decision to PANIC and sell at loss. WHICH ONLY MAKES SENSE IF YOUR GOAL IS TO LOSE MONEY.

EDIT:

Since WSB became a fucked up game of finding an imposter -> I was active on WSB a while ago on a different account (MICRON, early AMD) and since moved to subs like /r/financialindependence /r/FIRE etc. and switched to low-cost index funds and mainly stick to this kind of investments and kept an eye on WSB for enterntainment. This account has since been deleted by me because friends of mine (and coworkers) got ahold of that accounts username. I had some history that was too personal for them to know about.

I only moved onto the GME bandwagon out of spite, the moment BUY's got blocked on RH. This is the only and last ""WSB"" move I'm gonna do. 

It doesn't have any meaning as I could write whatever, but my username is my job in the banking sector. I know people that work in HF's, used to work decades in HF's. I didn't quite believe what they told me about the possibilities they have. But now I do.

Buy low, sell high is the foundation of any trade you do. Even GME. 

If you thought this move would be a quick buck over a few days, no. If you bought after the surge, it just doesn't make ANY sense selling. NONE. You cut your potential of any breakeven, ever.

Even if the short squeeze wouldn't happen due to highly illegal tactics by HF, GameStop has way more potential now than before. The company is in international spotlight, has an easy way to raise capital after the trade still, has global logistics... It still has potential as a company, if you sell now, you lose out on any chance of ever covering that loss."

1612312978.0,169,Cannabis stocks have turned into STONKS - my smooth-brain DD,"Listen here my fellow retards, my patience is running out on giving you free advice. I know short term meme stocks seem to be all the rage these days, but I believe the real tendies are being produced from the cannabis sector. 

MSOS (Cannabis ETF) is up 6% today and has already gone up \~25% on the year. Basically all the cannabis stocks have been exploding these past few months. I don't see this growth slowly down anytime soon and here are some reasons why.

* Both the **US and Mexico** are closing in on **federally legalizing cannabis**. Both of these countries are going to offer huge markets that will combine to be far bigger than Canada's current market.
* **More people are doing the 420**. Usage is going up everywhere and I don't see it dropping in the near future.
* Lots of cannabis companies are **getting majorly shorted** which is keeping their stock price down instead of going to the MOOOON 🚀🚀

Wouldn't be a fair DD without some risks though.....

* Although **US and Mexico** are strongly considering federal legalization, it **could still go south**. Backlash from legalizing or more important and pressing issues could easily push it to the back-burner or kill the idea all together for the near future.
* Although many health studies are coming out listing the benefits of cannabis, if some **serious health side-effects** come out in some studies it could scare people away from smoking the weed.
* There are far too many companies and lots of them are going to go **bankrupt** probably. Lots of room to get unlucky in your choices.

So what cannabis stonks should I be YOLOing into? A better first question might be: What should I be looking for in a cannabis stock?.

* **Profitable or near it:** Once the market really explodes it is going to be the companies with the cleanest balance sheets that are going to be able to make the big moves and print the real tendies. The companies with piles of debt and minimal profit will be left in the dust.
* **Has a foothold in multiple countries:** The more countries, states, licenses, land, etc., the better. All of these will allow for a head-start in the markets in that area.
* **Undervalued:** with lots of the cannabis stocks getting shorted to death, there are some cannabis stocks out there that I believe are extremely undervalued.

So what are your recommendations Mr. Smooth Brain?

* **APHA:** Tilray and Aphria are in the works of a serious and huge merger that will see them becoming one of (if not the biggest) cannabis company. Aphria's financials continue to be promising and Tilray's are not as solid but still decent. Aphria also acquired SweatWater giving them a solid start on cannabis related beverages. Aphria is the largest cannabis producer in Canada at 12.2% ([source](https://twitter.com/itsdgc/status/1356604397267124235)).  
So why APHA and not TLRY? When APHA and TLRY merge APHA shares will be .83 of a TLRY share. Because of this it is safe to assume APHA share price should = 0.83 x TLRY share price. TLRY share price is currently $25 which would mean that APHA share price should be around $20. For this reason APHA price being $15 right now is a steal assuming the merger goes through (looking promising for the merger to happen in Q2 this year).  

* **FIRE.TO/SPRWF:** I know what you are thinking.... ""this gay boomer bear smooth brain thinks a penny stock is a good idea!?!"".... hear me out. Supreme cannabis is one of those companies that never quite reached potential in the initial Canadian cannabis boom. Never had a real profitable quarter and has since been crushed to the ground by shorts ([source](https://shortdata.ca/stock/FIRE.TO/)). It has mostly been treated as just a dead stock and over the last few months people have dumbed on me for even mentioning this stock.  
I believe this is all about to turn around though. Supreme is having an earnings call on February 11th where I expect an extremely promising financial report and exciting upcoming news. Considering how undervalued this stock is (97 million market cap) it isn't going to take much to get this stock exploding. Volume and shorts have been exploding in this stock which shows huge promise. Supreme also makes up 3% of cannabis retail market in Canada ([source](https://twitter.com/itsdgc/status/1356604397267124235)). They also have connections in Australia and Israel markets.  


There are many more promising cannabis stonks out there and I encourage my fellow smooth brains to do their DD. Companies operating in multiple states are a safe bet ([check out this](https://www.greenmarketreport.com/the-cannabis-industrys-top-12-u-s-multi-state-operators/)). Also large companies like Canopy Growth, Curaleaf, etc. should all be decent stocks. If you are a retard interested in penny stocks check out FAF.TO and HITIF (along with SPRWF of course). 

Lots are coming out with earnings in the next few weeks, so keep your eyes out and remember to exercise those  💎🙌

My positions: APHA 20@$7, SPRWF 4480@$0.13, (I know... r/babystreetbets)..... I plan on dumping more into APHA and doubling down on SPRWF after earnings come out.

**TLDR**: Cannabis STONKS  🚀🚀🚀🚀. Exercise your 💎🙌 and HOLD. IMO buy APHA and risk it on SPRWF, but do your own DD on cannabis stonks."

You’re feeling pretty down, but guess what - it’s OK, we’ve all been there! Chances are every other successful investor out there have made mistakes in the past at some point, but you have to pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and try again if you want to become a billionaire stock trader. You just need to think about the lessons you’ve learned over this and try not to make them again. Seriously, most of the shit i do is a result of knowing what NOT to do vs. being successful at something.

For reference, here are some lessons I’ve learned over years of making dogshit mistakes investing:

* have a system and stick with it (i.e. screen stocks and make sure you only buy stocks with 20% insider ownership, a business model you understand, etc).
* have an exit strategy. If or when are you planning on selling?
* how would i feel about the volatility about this investment? If it dropped 50% would i pull my money out?
* talk through large investing decisions with a really good friend or partner. Get them to poke holes in your theories... you might find what made sense in your head actually was dumb as hell.
* trade in a tax efficient vehicle so you don’t get dinged by the IRS.
* if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is (i once literally bought speakers out of a van with my last $300, and they didn’t work... just lmao).
* chances are all this time dedicated to this whole stock thing isn’t worth it because investing 100% in VTI will beat your picks most years (and you’ll be a lot less stressed out)
* people like Chamath, Portnoy, Cuban, AOC, Cruz, are just inflating their own ego and Twitter clout by appearing like they’re on one side vs another. They actually don’t give a shit about you.

Anyway, just wanted to throw out a note for those not feeling that great right now. I see you and feel for you and we’ve all been there 🤠. Maybe some other WSBers can share lessons or war stories to help other newbies."

What comes to mind when you think of BlackBerry? Phones? Your a chump if you answered phones.

TLDR up front, BlackBerry has pivoted away from making phones and instead is in the software sector. Some big names that they have include, [SpaceX](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=0&article=1737&context=smallsat&type=additional), [Amazon](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/blackberry-and-amazon-web-services-partner-on-ivy-tech-for-your-car/), **Nvidia**, **NIO**, **Xpeng**, **Ford** and 19 out of the 25 EV companies now use QNX. (*New info as of 2/2/21 at bottom*)

**Software**

BlackBerry has gone away from the phones business and has reinvented itself to become the main player in Automobile OS systems. They have lock and key in this market since many OEMs don't want to start from the ground up making the software themselves. As of June,2020 they have the QNS software in over[175 million cars](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-175-million-vehicles-301081594.html). Nvidia uses BlackBerries QNX for the base of its [self-driving car](https://channeldailynews.com/news/nvidia-to-build-its-ai-self-driving-platform-on-blackberry-qnx/58048). Sony is also partners with Nvidia and BlackBerry for the car they are [making.](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sony-reveals-more-details-on-its-secretive-vision-s-sedan/) Not to mention the companies that use QNX are subscription based, so reoccurring revenue. This is speculation on this part but Hyundai is using QNX and has partnered with Apple, and carplay is a layer built on QNX.

**Fundamentals**

BlackBerry recently just sold all of there phone [patents](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-blackberry-sells-90-patents-to-huawei-covering-key-smartphone/) to Huawai showing that they are no longer in the phone sector. Big Boys have been adding more BB to there pockets and the last 13F was on the 15th (1/15/21) (Fin---tel)

I had pictures to show it but the braindead bot removed it.

Other big short inst---itutions have a hard on for keeping this low, BB was in the top 20 most shorted stocks but GME was number 1. Just this Friday(1/15) Shorts and inst---itutions sold alot.

The **50 dayMA crossed the 200dayMA** in December and has held since then. Also check out that 188million green.

Morningstar and CFRA both put $BB with a fair value price of 6.40, so you can assume that is the absolute bottom. (copied from [u/ThegreatLoudini](https://www.reddit.com/u/ThegreatLoudini/))

**(New Info 2/2/21)**

I am unable to use emojis off my laptop so please excuse me for not having enough rocket ships but I promise you this rocket ship is fueling up and we are a couple months away from blast off if not sooner.

Why should you trust me?

I am an economics major with a concentration in entrepreneurship and a minor in sales. I love money more than hookers love blow and I intend on making a lot of money so I can afford the hookers that like blow. I go to a pretty prestigious university and I love how WallStreetBets can connect ""smart"" money with ""autist"" money. I am 100% all in on APHA with my entire life savings because as Warren Buffett would say, "" ""**Diversification** is a protection against ignorance,"" ""\[It\] makes very little sense for those who know what they're doing.""  and I know what I am doing so I full sent it.

&#x200B;

Why APHA?

They are conservative with their spending is what got me hooked first. Compared to other marijuana companies like ACB or Tilray, they aren't riddled with debt right off the back. (i'll get to the Tilray merger in a bit). This company has the cash on hand to purchase a MSO (multi-state operator) as soon as the US legalizes and my bet is that they are going to go for a MSO that has a heavy presence in Florida as the CFO stated in an AMA on reddit that Florida is where the market is, not California. The difference between APHA and any MSO or other LP is the fact that APHA merging with Tilray creates the first MCO or Multi-country operator. This means the company will be taking a piece of the cake from multiple cakes. You don't need to be #1 in America or Canada whenever you are directly engaged in multiple operations all over the world that increase your market share to be #1 worldwide.

&#x200B;

With APHA and Tilray merging... which stonk do you buy? Easy, APHA.

The arbitrage play has APHA being changed to .83 of 1 Tilray share.

Currently tilray trades at 24.95 x 0.83 = 20.708

The current APHA price? 15.25.

This means that the gap has to close before the merger but is Tilray going to go down with all the pro marijuana news coming out? No, APHA has to go up to close the gap and today alone APHA is up 17.92% based on pro marijuana legalization news. BUT WAIT! Tilray is up 22.98% which means the GAP IS ONLY GETTING WIDER just like your wife's pussy after letting her 5 boyfriends have a turn since you've been so busy focusing on your GME stonk going down due to market manipulation.

&#x200B;

The financials of APHA are strong, they FINALLY posted a profit of 0.01 EPS which may seem like little bitch shit but in reality most cannabis companies haven't hit profitability yet so they are ahead of the game. The one great thing about their financials is that Sweetwater Brewing wasn't factored into the earnings report which is AWESOME (Insert hellllaaa rocket emojis here). They are already turning a profit and THEN they are going to be adding more profits from a brewery that has strong revenue growth and turns a profit onto their balance sheet. While other companies have to figure out how to keep demand up after the holiday season, APHA has a raft to float on since Sweetwater provides a great level of float to the company. (I will post all relevant news articles at the end). The merge with Tilray makes this combined company a player in, Canada, Portugal, France, and then Sweetwater gives them US brand recognition. How does a beer company give US brand recognition? Look up the Sweetwater brand and you will see that this is a beer company for stoners and that is exactly what APHA needed. Right now the stock is stilling at $15 which is still relatively low, I can see this hitting anywhere from $50-75 EOY and like I said, I have my entire life savings in this stonk because I know the end of prohibition means the chance for the next Anheuser Busch which APHA is best positioned to become.

There's even more reasons to invest but I'm sure you get the point. This is going to be huge and if you're looking for a play in the marijuana sector this is your best option. Go on the weedstocks subreddit if you want even more verification or to see some alternative opinions. I made this post as a throwback to the good ole days to when WSB wasn't only about GME and AMC but also new emerging sectors. This is a great stock and I wouldn't have taken the time out of my busy schedule unless the time to blast off was fast approaching. Listen or don't I am gonna make tendies, I just want to share the wealth.

Sweetwater is actually a very big deal that is overlooked. They are expanding into more states which is simply creating a distribution chain for APHA/Tilray to distribute their product through. Imagine already having warehouses, sales reps, and shipping routes established before the US legalizes. APHA is going to be an MSO and MCO. The only thing that scares me is that democrats have said they don't want big companies coming in to sweep up market share whenever minorities have been directly impacted by the war on drugs. Could go both ways but Sweetwater provides somewhat of a foundation for the balance sheet and then the intrinsic value of the relationships/brand recognition that will already be established before any other LPs can get into the market will have APHA/Tilray the clear cut winner of the LPs. I strongly urge anyone that wants to get further into the marijuana investing space to visit the sub reddit Weedstocks rather than spamming WSB with these types of posts whenever their is a different sub dedicated to it. I have been a member of WSB and Weedstocks for over a year and both subs have their pros and cons.

This is for new people getting intimated by the volume today and seeing it was higher compared to yesterday and are wondering why the price is still down. What happened on open was a decline downwards all the way down to $70-80 running on LITERALLY the same amount of volume yesterday at around 20-30 million, but as it hit $70-$80 you beautiful fuckers 🦍💎 didn’t sell but instead gobbled that shit up all the way to $140 hence the spike in volume. When it went down again to $90 at closing you can see that the volume is also low similar to the decline at open. *Theoretically if they just kept reducing the price and no one bought but held we would have closed lower than $90 and would have definitely closed with close to the same amount of volume as yesterday*. I feel like people are missing the fact that it didn’t just go down in price it also went up.

1612311804.0,5333,"The ratio of short volume to total volume confirms the GME sell-off over the last few days is shorting, not real selling. GME 🚀🚀","Many people here have pointed out that this selling seems artificial, multiple brokers report overwhelming buy orders, etc. The official data are in complete agreement with that. S3 and Ortex data are estimates, but FINRA data (from which the bimonthly official short interest reports are generated; this is the best there is) have shown that for the last five days, more than 50% of shares sold have been sold short:

[http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210202.txt](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210202.txt) (search GME; see also [2/1](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210201.txt), [1/29](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210129.txt), [1/28](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210128.txt), [1/27](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210127.txt))

[https://nakedshortreport.com/company/GME](https://nakedshortreport.com/company/GME) (pretty plot, though the data are slightly different from the official data given in the links above; both sources confirm that short volume has been > 50% total volume over the last five days, including today)

As an aside, according to that second website, [""if you see  more than 20% of your overall volume initiated short on a daily basis... you may be under \[a naked short\] attack.""](https://nakedshortreport.com/how-to-detect-short-trades) SEC, a little help, please?

In any case, the day before Robinhood and other brokers instituted the restriction on GME share and option buying was the last day that more than ***50%*** of *all GME shares sold* were not sold short. Shorts have been going in even harder on their shorting while they know buying is difficult for us. We win if we hold.

This is pretty definitive that shorts are causing the current crash, and they definitely haven't covered when doing so. It's mathematically impossible for shorts to cover if more than 50% of all shares sold in a day were sold short. Shorts are instead continuing to double down. GME will eventually rise, especially if Cohen and friends give some good news anytime soon (e.g., official company roadmap released, Cohen and friends buying the remaining shares they can, etc.). It will rise regardless of good news because shorts don't want to pay interest forever if a stock trades sideways. And as soon as all of us can buy an unlimited amount again, we can squeeze them once again.

I've shared FINRA data on here before and gotten some questions which have at this point become predictable, so I'm going to answer them below.

# Couldn't shorts open their position and cover by the end of the day?

No, because more than 50% of all shares were sold short, there were not enough shares for them to cover the shares they sold short even if every single share purchased other than a short share today was sold from a long to a short. It's mathematically impossible. They had to add at least around 10% of the total volume each of the last five days to their short position (most days had about 55% of shares sold short (some even more), and 100 - 55 = 45% not sold short; 55 - 45 = 10% more shares sold short than shares sold long). And I know that I bought more over each of the last few days, as did you glorious autists, so it was probably more than 10% of the total volume they were adding per day for each of the last five days.

# The total volume from those websites is less than the day's volume that my broker or another site tells me was traded

Yes, that's because FINRA only records data from specific markets/exchanges, not all of them. Although the total volume is less than what is sold over the entire market, the *ratio* of short sales to total shares sold is representative of the entire market, because they pull from the biggest exchanges. As mentioned above, FINRA is also the highest quality short data; the official bimonthly short data that is published is by FINRA pulling from these same data. These data are accurate.

&#x200B;

Edit to add: I am not a financial analyst and this is not financial advice. Make up your own mind about everything. Also, I am long GME. 

**TLDR:** Shorts have added a retardedly large amount of new short positions over the last five days. Keep holding, don't sell, and when you can buy more buy more. **GME to fucking Orion's belt 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**"

I'll start by explaining the difference between Box Office sales vs Streaming.  Streaming is like DVD sales, where the production company must sign over rights to the movie to the service which eliminates any chance at residuals such as Box Office sales which is where a majority of their profit lies.  My theory is that this is why we've only very few ""good"" movies recently, most of the production companies are sitting on their canned file waiting for COVID to be over.

Why I think AMC dropped the ball...  AMC, like other movie theaters already have agreements in place to share ""Box Office"" proceeds with the production companies.  I'm not sure why they wouldn't get creative and offer this same model up during COVID and get a leg up on their competition (Amazon, Google, etc...).  My guess, the same reason that I had to spend an hour doing DD just to find out that the only reason I could see them being viable into the future, they ALREADY had a product for and just don't do anything with.  Their leadership is completely incompetent and the company was being shorted into bankruptcy for a reason.

AVOID AMC like the fucking plague stock that it is..."

1612311417.0,326,Today I'd like to say fuck you to the hedgefunds from an exploited working stiff RANT,"I like many of you work a shit job where I'm underpaid, exploited, stressed and angry. Today I found out in the coming weeks us disposable workers are about to get a shit more work, responsibility and stress going forward. After layoffs, paycuts, tightening our builts, closing offices permanently and working from home permanently I get to experience more suffering.

So that brings me to GME and the hedgefunds. I like you jumped on this movement, because that's what it is at this point, and bought one GME share because I suck and don't have the nerves of you seasoned monkeys when it comes to stocks (rip my 4 TSLA shares circa 2017). I saw what hedgefunds were trying to do and how us normal people, gamers, boyfriends, degenerates could capitalize and actually win for once in this shitty rigged system that fucks us over every day from work wages to healthcare and taxes. I was amazed at how mainstream media said fuck me when I tried to make money and was calling for bullshit regulation and peddling silver because me a guy almost 30 who has done nothing but go to college to get a worthless price of paper following the 08 crash and be told just work hard and you'll get ahead. I've been exploited by shit jobs, government who doesn't give a shit about me (hey here's two measiy still checks to compensate for another 10 years of no wage growth) and now a fucking financial system so fucking rigged that even criminals like Pablo Escobar would in awe if he were alive. Robinhood suddenly locking out of my account that has been dormant for two year, fuck you Vlad by the way, hope you go to prison. Fidelity fuck the world.

So I'm holding my 1 share. I've debated on selling to cut my losses but who the fuck cares. If this destroys a hedgefund fucking good! If I have to hold until it's worth $5 I will. These fucking banker and financial cunts need to lose and suffer like we do daily. They don't know what it's like to enyer a shit job market and be stuck in it for a fucking decade and ask for fucking tax breaks and still do illegal shit like blatantly manipularlte the free market.

I've platinumed Battlefield 4 and over 30 other games. Who do you think you're missing with? If u/deepfuckingvalue can hold and the other troopers around the world I sure as hell can. Do you know why it's not about the money anymore ^^well ^^acrually ^^$10000 ^^would ^^be ^^sweet it's about being on the right side or history and doing what's right.

1612311346.0,101,“We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools” – Martin Luther King. Jr,"An important aspect of trading emotionally is valuing integrity and morality. An emotional trader must, above all else, think of the repercussions their investments may have on the world at large. Could you really sleep at night knowing that you are personally funding terrorists or child exploitation?

**The answer is no.**
____

The impact buying or selling shares has on other people is often conveniently overlooked. Mainstream investors, teachers, and self-proclaimed gurus choose to ignore the broader implications of these interpersonal interactions out of moral convenience. To them, that which is not seen, can do no harm. This culture of permissiveness is in violation of human dignity. Every trade that is made, every contract that is processed, is a personal transaction, that of which dates back to Babylonian times. The biggest implication of the result of this shift in perspective surrounds the idea of bag holding.

**Outside of the world of finance, bag holding refers to a form of common courtesy.** That is, if you were to perhaps see an elderly woman holding many bags of shopping, one might partake in bag holding such that said elderly woman was disencumbered.

In the realm of investing, this socially positive term has been *twisted* to refer to traders who refuse to sell shares cheaply. This term is often employed by market manipulators as well as losers who sold and are looking for reaffirmation that they are not alone in their losses.

An interpersonal perspective helps an outsider understand what the emotional investor is doing, and sheds light on the concept of bag holding. Once again, human behavior imitates life. Kind-hearted individuals hold the metaphysical bags of those who cannot afford to (the “old women” in this metaphor). That is, those who are strong, have more wealth available to trade, take on the burden of those who cannot, the old women.

Indeed a cold, heartless view of  markets and investing may lead some to believe that it is okay to let old women struggle and fail whilst attempting to cross the street carrying groceries. However, experienced investors will attest to the moral duty we as humans must carry in the advancement, not only of ourselves, but of the weakest among us.

**Life changing realizations of this nature have powerful impacts on our lives.**

As a coping mechanism, I suggest to you that **crying** is the most efficient method of displaying sadness and sorrow in these situations, **not selling**. Sobs are a universal sign of distress, discontent, and loss. As such, tears may be seen as a commodity. Although an emotional investor will, at all times, avoid selling, and above all else, avoid being a loser, there are particular situations where there simply may not be a lesson to exchange for the sale of your position. That is to say, there may be nothing to learn.

_____
**TLDR**

In days like today, an intelligent well-trained emotional investor will fall back to basic principles of loss aversion and exchange their losses for their value equivalent in tears. In fact, tears may be the most valuable commodity of all. **Only losers sell**. Serious investors learn. Serious investors **cry**."

1612311182.0,252,If there is a short squeeze here is why it will happen before the 9th.,"So before I start. I AM retarded. I may be wrong and this is not advise at all to buy or sell.

That being said here is why I think that the squeeze, if it’s real, will happen before the 9th

BACKGROUND;


When this whole thing started, it started because many traders realized the potential for there to be a squeeze, when realizing this, the stock sky rocketed to my anus and Uranus and everyone’s anus. The important thing to note is that this happened because of a mix of gamma and short squeeze (But not THE wet dream short squeeze everyone is referring too)

When / if the squeeze happens there won’t be a run up like before, most people who are hyped about this already bought. (there is only so much money in traders accounts)

it will likely happen in waves of huge green dildos as companies rush to buy back before another short company buys first and raises the price for them.

They will all try to fight each other because if one company buys back, they are screwing over the others. Which means waves of price increases


What does this have to do with the 9th?

Well on the 9th we will see how many shares are shorted, looking back at how this all started we see it was because of people realizing short interest was high. 

TWO SCENARIOS:


Scenario 1;
 
If on the 9th people see they haven’t covered their shorts or only partially covered and the short interest is still high then the buying frenzy will re ignite and the price will shoot as people wait for the short squeeze.

This is very bad for the company. This means that if the short interest IS high then they would want to buy back before the 9th that way people don’t have much time to react and raise their limit sells when they see the short interest percent. 

Scenario 2; 

Short interest is low and we are fucked. Not much to be said here. No short squeeze


One last thing. The squeeze (if it happens) will happen after a red day because these companies will want to lower the will of shareholders as much as they possibly could to incentivize them to sell at the first sign of green


TLDR: when monkeys see numbers of short interest on the 9th one two things will happen

1: it’s high and the squeeze begins before the numbers are revealed so monkey can’t react.

2: bulls are fuk"

*This is not financial advice, I'm not an expert, etc*

\*\*WHY SHOULD WE STILL HOLD?\*\* I know there's a lot of sentiment around solidarity, and sticking it to the man, and 'fuck it, I'm down so much anyway'. NONE OF THESE ARE GOOD REASONS TO HOLD. I'm here to talk about the actual reasons to hold.

Here's our biggest problem: **Misinformation**

There is a lot of information being spread around like manure. Mostly unread, mostly un-disseminated, basically just a whole bunch of positive sounding claims meant to serve as confirmation bias.

How do we ensure we're not just buying into bullshit? **By determining exactly what data we have available to make decisions as of right now**. That is what I intend to review (and hopefully gather from you apes) here today.

**A REVIEW OF THE FORCES ACTING ON GME**

1. **Fundamental Value:** This isn't relevant right now. GME is presently a $20/share company, even with Ryan Cohen shooting magic rainbows out of his ass it's not worth more than $60 until they actually start changing their business model. When that happens the value will go up, for now 30% yoy online revenue growth doesn't mean shit in the bigger picture.
2. **Momentum:** This is the biggest reason we hit $500/share, and the biggest reason we're still at $90, way above fundamental value. Here's something to consider: **Momentum, not the squeeze, is why the share price is where it is -** rather, the growing global awareness of the squeeze provided the evidence needed for everyone to rush to get onboard.  But, people are also idiots. Momentum can change directions quickly from an upward to downward pressure, and can be easily manipulated, as we've seen.
3. **THE SHORT SQUEEZE:** What actually causes the high short interest to result in raised share prices? Short sellers who are actually (not theoretically) pressured into closing their positions at an overall loss, and en masse. If most of the shorters can wait out or hedge against their losing positions, then there never has to be a mad rush to buy up shares at whatever price. *Do you actually think Melvin Capital was at any point margin called?*  If/when they exited, they did so in an orderly fashion that best served their interest, to the point that they were straight up given a multi-billion dollar bailout by their competitors! These people don't play by the same rules as you, you fucking braindead monkey.
4. **The Gamma Squeeze:** Last Friday, for the second Friday in a row, a vast majority of calls expired In The Money, and a bunch of call owners were owed shares by today (T+2 rule). The theory behind the gamma squeeze is that call sellers didn't have good risk models and didn't hedge their calls well enough, and so didn't actually  own enough underlying shares to hand over, and now need to rush to buy them at market price. Could that be why there was a massive spike from 80 to 150 this afternoon? Maybe. **But a gamma squeeze can also backfire**. All those people assigned shares may not have the tens of thousands in cash ready to buy, or the margin to borrow. That means all those shares get dumped back on the marketplace.
5. Straight up motherfuckin dirty illegal manipulationOh, best believe it happened, and is still happening. Just to review the hits:
   1. DTCC and/or Retail brokers prevent buying, artificially suppressing demand for Thu price drop and locking up people's money till they could transfer elsewhere.
   2. Sudden increases to margin requirements and severe margin calling
   3. A massive media campaign to announce shorts closed positions and everyone is in Silver
   4. Retail brokers cancelling orders, restricting limit prices, enforcing unwanted stop losses (eToro),
   5. Illegal coordinated short ladder attacks to drive down price and fish for stop losses and paper hands.

&#x200B;

**OK, BUT YOU KNEW ABOUT ALL THIS. WHAT'S IMPORTANT NOW IS**

***WHAT EVIDENCE DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF PLAY?***

&#x200B;

No, really, I'm asking. Our advantage is in our ability to crowdsource information. I will edit and update this list as information is shared. Meanwhile I'll try to flesh out a framework as best I can.

**Argument #1: The Squeeze is not Squoze because Short Interest is still high**

* Claim: As long as the Short Interest exceeds the Float, there is a supply problem for short sellers. This *may* translate into pressure from lenders on short sellers over time, driving the squeeze.
* Evidence needed: What is the current short interest?
   * S3 partners provides estimates using a model, and as of today claim it is only **51% of free float**:Source: [https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752)

&#x200B;

* Ortex data provides another estimate using another model, and as of yesterday claims it is only 27 mil shares, only a million shares difference from S3Source: [https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts](https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts)

https://preview.redd.it/yo2s5e2cg5f61.png?width=1691&format=png&auto=webp&s=d83701a452b5aaa079e3a3948cecbbb3feb77b5a

&#x200B;

* **REAL DATA:** The SEC releases reported short interest twice a month. The most recent data we have is from Jan 15, and wasn't released to the public until Jan 27.\*\*On Jan 15 the SI was 131%.\*\*The next report for Jan 31 won't be available until Feb 9.Frankly, we can't rely on the REAL data, because it's delayed too long to be relevant.
* Evidence needed: What is the actual free float?
   * I still need help finding this. I know 71 Million shares have been issued overall, but a lot of that is locked up in institutions that would have to report any selloffs within 3 days. If 27 million shorts still need to close, how many shares are readily available?
   * Yahoo Finance puts Float at 46.89 mil shares, FWIWSource: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/)

**Argument #2: There hasn't been enough trading volume for shorts to possibly close**

* Claim: assuming \~27 mil shorted, not enough shares exchanged hands since the price blew up to close those positions.
* Evidence: Someone explain to me how this isn't enough volume for shorts to cover. Mark Cuban said pretty much the same thing in his AMA today.

|Date|Trade Volume|
|:-|:-|
|2/2 Tue|77.8m|
|2/1 Mon|37.3m|
|1/29 Fri|50.5m|
|1/28 Thu|58.5m|
|1/27 Wed|93.3m|

**Argument #3: Short Sellers will are under pressure to close, so the squeeze is coming**

* Claim: Short sellers are bleeding money trying to outlast us with their losing positions, and will eventually prefer (or be forced) to close out the loss rather than be caught in the squeeze.
* Evidence needed: Shorts are (on average) in a losing position at current share price ($90), and can't just close right now at profit
* Evidence needed: Any external pressure on shorters to close their position at a loss rather than waiting us out for the price to drop further

&#x200B;

**Argument #4: Market manipulation shenanigans didn't work, and retailers didn't sell off en masse, creating the liquidity shorts need to close cheaply.**

* Claim: Price dips happened during low volume trading (short ladder market manipulation etc), and the longs are holding fast.
* Counterevidence: THE MOTHERFUCKING $300 PRICE DROP YOU DUMB FUCKING NUGGETS
* Evidence: This popular screenshot of Fidelity's order ratio:Source: [https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml)

https://preview.redd.it/5jnmtl00l5f61.png?width=1021&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9e676fbd3e0811f826463f14d4b9c12971ed6b2

* Counterargument: Order counts don't mean shit. For every share traded there is a buyer and a seller. So 100k buyers buy one share each, and 40k sellers sell 3 shares each. Or 20k buyers place 5 buy orders for one share each, and there are less buyers than sellers overall. WHO KNOWS? This strikes me as very insufficient evidence for bullishness, serving only as confirmation bias for bagholders.
* **Evidence needed:** Something more concrete that better proves that more shareholders held than sold.
* Evidence needed: other brokerages data on buy vs sell orders. Fidelity is just one broker, and a retail broker at that. Hedgies don't trade with Fidelity.

&#x200B;

**Argument #5: The biggest dips were driven by short-ladder attacks during low volume periods**

* Claim: the decrease in price from 500 to 90 is mostly fueled by artificial suppression of demand and fake selling (short ladders), and not so much by change in momentum.
* Evidence: At this point its guesswork based on limited evidence provided by redditors. Essentially, round share numbers sold within microseconds at fractional prices
   * [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la682h/visual\_representation\_of\_a\_short\_ladder\_attack\_4/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la682h/visual_representation_of_a_short_ladder_attack_4/)
   * [https://i.redd.it/qoyvz8grr3f61.jpg](https://i.redd.it/qoyvz8grr3f61.jpg)
* Counterargument: short ladder attacks are straight up not real, conspiracy theory confirmation bias invented by WSB itself: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/latax6/short\_ladders\_are\_not\_real/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/latax6/short_ladders_are_not_real/)
* Evidence needed: I've seen but can't find better video evidence showing the stream of rapid trades at fractional prices and round share counts (100 shares at a time), could use that. \\
* Counterargument: The artificially reduced volume from Robin Hood and other brokers limiting access has now been largely removed, as RH allows 100 shares and by now people had time to transfer funds to another broker. Damage to momentum was done, but if there is still a valid thesis it should just mean people can buy the dip, right?
* Evidence needed: That the price dips over the last 48 hours haven't been accompanied by massive trading volume. I'm seeing a lot, especially compared to Thursday's artificial suppression:

https://preview.redd.it/77a0euotp5f61.png?width=1884&format=png&auto=webp&s=62b0af04608cb5fb235895d8bbd03b9e19a00588

&#x200B;

**Argument #6: 'You are here on the VW short squeeze chart'**

* Claim: See how the famous VW short squeeze also had a massive price drop before it blew up? That's us right now.
* Evidence: A single, solitary chart

https://preview.redd.it/mx6fs2f5r5f61.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=60cc9096c46097b7328c59c2572b3466e5241131

* Counterargument: the VW scenario was not the same as the GME play. VW share liquidity plummeted literally overnight when it was revealed that Porsche had bought up 90% of the float (check me on that fact, I'm repeating secondhand info). See the big dip AFTER the squeeze? How do we know we aren't *there*?
* Evidence needed: IDK, some kind of coherent explanation of why VW dipped like that, and why a similar dip would be expected in the GME Play

It takes several days before the information is published and by that time, the number of shares short in the market may have already changed.""

Short likely were covering as the price increased. Now I agree that GME was manipulated and if it were not it likely could have run to 1K while other stocks may have run up higher too like AMC. However I really hope everyone understands that GME likely never sees those highs again. Furthermore this spamming of ""Hold"" is probably making the majority of WSB lose money.

All in all the squeeze was right and the manipulation did happen but the top was last week and it's not coming back."

While these battles rage on there are many more. While I fully support the GME & AMC run I noticed the new steam brewing about a silver squeeze. 

The idea of a silver squeeze was quickly turned down and here at WSB due to Citadel owning many calls on SLV and other tickers. 

But we must notice the bigger picture here, JP Morgan is a huge player in the manipulation of these commodities and they should be held accountable.

They are just as bad as citadel, we must remember the message behind the run ups on GME AMC and more. This same message might actually apply to silver. I think it might actually be worth looking into brothers, this is a potentially good choice, that’s all I’m asking is for you to double check the situation of silver.

Ape together strong, long GME AMC.

Edit: remember the message boys, the reason behind the trades, let us learn and expand our expertise on these specific set of requirements and logistics in the future. Stay true to the message and meaning."

1612310108.0,13,$MGNI: Why it is STILL a great time to buy in,"  

**TL/DR at the bottom**

I do not see nearly enough love for MGNI on r/stocks or WSB so I want to give you all a look in at a one-way ticket to gains.

**What does Magnite ($MGNI) do?**

\- **World’s largest independent supply-side advertising technology company**. This means they help fill advertising space, primarily on websites, apps, and **connected TV (CTV)** platforms. Price per share at time of writing: $40.20

**CTV -** Basically anything that is not cable TV is connected TV. Connecting through your xbox or roku or apple TV or however you want to stream TV. This is the **primary source of revenue** for $MGNI. Are you on the poor people version of Hulu that runs ads? Those ads run through MGNI.

So let me ask you - is there a movement towards cable TV, or a movement towards finding other ways to watch TV through streaming services? I think you know the answer. And that is reason #1 to buy in. **As CTV increases in popularity, so does demand for advertising space, and so does $MGNI revenue.**

**Industry comparison -**

Trade Desk ($TTD). TTD operates on the buy side of ad tech, so while not exactly the same, they are within the same industry. TTD is currently **up 2800%** over the last 4 years, with a market cap of $38.5 billion. Where is $MGNI? A shade under $5 billion. Now is it realistic to expect MGNI to be the next home run play like TTD (who my brother sold for $50/share, RIP)? Predicting anything to go up 2800% in 4 years is unlikely but who knows. But **if MGNI can get to even half the market cap of TTD, that is a price target of $160.** (Current: $40/share, Mcap 4.75 Billion)

**Past/future earnings:**

Past earnings and future earnings show the story of a company with fairly rapid growth. Take a look for yourself:

Q1 2020 Revenue - $36.3MM, up 12% YoY from Q1 2019

Q2 2020 Revenue - $42.3MM, up 12% YoY from Q2 2019

Q3 2020 Revenue - $61MM, up 62% YoY from Q3 2019

*Q4 2020 Revenue - Expected $72-75MM, up \~50% YoY from Q4 2019*

**$MGNI is up %335 in the past 12 mo, am I too late to the party?**

Answer: **NO,** and although I already outlined some reasons why above, here is a list for you:

&#x200B;

1. CTV will      only increase in popularity, which is where the bulk of MGNI revenue comes      from
2. $MGNI is      showing accelerated growth, great for a mid-cap company to try to make the      jump to large-cap
3. Trade Desk      (TTD), who is not a competitor but is in the same industry, is valued      nearly 10x higher than MGNI.
4. Earnings      coming up 2/24, which I expect MGNI to crush, and I do not think that      earnings are priced in yet.
5. Needham      analyst Laura Martin makes MGNI her top pick for 2021, saying 500% growth      is possible (Jan 13 [Why Wall Street analysts think Magnite may be the      next hot play in ad tech (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/why-wall-street-analysts-think-magnite-may-be-the-next-hot-play-in-ad-tech.html))
6. Survived a      short hit piece by Spruce Point Capital on Jan 8 (Thank you for a low      entry point for some calls)
7. **PR Today: Launch of “Unified Decisioning”,** a new MGNI product/software. From article:

*“Publishers are eager to tap into the efficiencies that programmatic provides without relinquishing the control they are used to when selling directly to buyers. Unified Decisioning enables them to do both and we’re excited to bring these capabilities to leading CTV publishers.”* Link: [*Magnite Introduces Open Beta of New CTV & OTT Solution Named Unified Decisioning | Business Wire*](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210202005138/en/Magnite-Introduces-Open-Beta-of-New-CTV-OTT-Solution-Named-Unified-Decisioning)

If you’re interested in companies that are trending from bottom-left to top-right, then I encourage you to invest in $MGNI. I believe it is a **good short-term play**; having just went on a weeklong dip from Jan 22 - Jan 29, I think you have a decent entry point here at $41.50, although I believe any entry point is fine at this stage in the company’s growth. Also in the short-term is earnings on 2/24 which I believe will be good for MGNI. It is also a **good long-term play** for reasons above, my EOY price target is $125, although it would not surprise me if it goes significantly higher. The $MGNI train hasn’t even left the station!

Positions: 100 shares @ $16, 2/19 35c x5, 2/19 40c x2, 2/19 45c x10, 2/19 50c x2 (Slight degeneracy)

**TL/DR:** MGNI is a growing company in the growing industry of advertising in (primarily) connected TV services (Think: Roku). Same realm as $TTD but 1/10th the market cap. Much room to grow. Earnings coming up 2/24 and Laura Martin’s stock pick of 2021. Just released beta of new software today. Not financial advice, I just like the stock."
1612310103.0,165,"Why the guy I saw on r/stocks is a smooth brained mouth breather, or why I still have diamond hands","I saw post over on r/stocks earlier today.  I'm ngl, it freaked me the fuck out like some sort of anti-moon tardo.  I totally fell for the FUD as my beloved rocket stonk continues to swan dive into my wife's boyfriends bunghole.

So onto why the pheasant's FUD ended up only causing an hours long instead of perma brain damage.  BECAUSE HE IS A SMOOTH MOUTH BREATHER:

1. Fact one: Buying has been greater than selling. Buying has been greater than selling. Everyone knows that if we buy and hold, a payday will come at some point thanks to the hedgies continuing to double down on GME shorts.
2. Fact two: multiple stonks have mirrored movement.  See AMC for an example.
3. Fact three: Volume is too fucking low.  Volume was only 77mil today looking at RH.
4. Fact four: the hedgies aren't closing their positions, see #3.  There are no more shares available to short.
5. Fact five: I haven't gone FULL retard.  Never go FULL retard.

&#x200B;

My personal opinion is that we are never going to be able to build up enough momentum alone to turn this thing around.  But we don't have to.  We do not need momentum anymore, we just need to maintain scarcity of the shorted stocks.  Literally, just need to hold until the hedgies starts to close their positions, hold for as long as possible, then its all over.

This isn't a bubble, this isn't some overblown hype train, this is just the way of these meme stonks.  

This isn't a get rich quick scheme, this is buying tickets to the squeeze show.  Tickets just went on discount.  Anyone bailing is a smoothed brained pheasant.  Fuck you, fight me in the Wendy's. I am an alpha ape with a big pp. \*spams emojis\*"

Anyway, what is confusing me about all this is the statistics, maybe its because I'm a retarded tendie loving idiot, so maybe someone could explain to me what I'm seeing.

On Yahoo Finance, It says that the percentage of shares owned by insiders is 27.33% and the percentage of shares held by institutions is 122.04%. How can there be more than 100% of a company? & that's not even including retail investors (or maybe it does, again, I'm retarded) 
Okay, that seems weird but what about this other stuff? like the fact that there are supposed to be a total of 69,000,000 shares outstanding, yet over 61,000,000 shares are shorted? is it really possible for there to be less than 8,000,000 shares that aren't being shorted? and if that was the case wouldn't there be no way for us (retail investors) to bring the price up at all? 🤔🤔🤔

Also, the short percentage of the float is 226.42% for Gamestop when I did research into the other top shorted stocks, Bed Bath and Beyond was mentioned so I decided to check their statistics versus Gamestop, and their percentage of the float was 82%. 

So i decided to compare the numbers of the Top 5 “Best Heavily Shorted Stocks To Buy Right Now” from Nasdaq.com 📈

just look at the stats: 

AMC 🎞

Shares Outstanding: 287.28M
% Held By Insiders: 2.30%
% Held by Institutions: 37.24% 
Shares Short: 44.67M
Short % of Float: 38.12%
Short % of Shares Outstanding: 20.67%

GME 🎮

Shares Outstanding: 69.75M
% Held By Insiders: 27.33%
% Held by Institutions: 122.04%
Shares Short: 61.78M 
Short % of Float: 226.42%
Short % of Shares Outstanding: 88.58%

BBBY 🧴

Shares Outstanding: 121.22M
% Held By Insiders: 5.76%
% Held by Institutions: 117.88%
Shares Short: 74.89M
Short % of Float: 82.41%
Short % of Shares Outstanding: 61.78%

SPCE 🚀

Shares Outstanding: 234.34M
% Held By Insiders: 40%
% Held by Institutions: 29.72%
Shares Short: 38.6M 
Short % of Float: 56.15%
Short % of Shares Outstanding: 16.47%

FUBO 📺

Shares Outstanding: 108.85M
% Held By Insiders: 17.38%
% Held by Institutions: 7.24%
Shares Short: 39.17M
Short % of Float: 72.74%
Short % of Shares Outstanding: 57.98%

As you can see Gamestop (GME) has the least amount of shares outstanding (by far) of any of these stocks, yet has the second most number of shares shorted behind BBBY which has almost DOUBLE the amount of shares outstanding. 

So, 
AMC has 15.5% of it’s total shares shorted
BBBY has 61.7% of its total shares shorted
FUBO has 35.98% of its total shares shorted
SPCE has 16.47% of its total shares shorted

But GME has 88.57% of it’s shares shorted!?!?!?!?

Look, I am not a financial advisor and none of this is financial advice, and I may be just a retard, but this retard thinks that everything going on with Gamestop is not just unsusal but downright strange. 

Is there any explanation that someone can give me that explains why GME is being shorted SO MUCH, and why it’s stats are like that? 🙌🏻💎"

Bull Case:

\-Another round of stimmy will give us all a boost

\-Short interest as of 2/2 is growing.  [https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme) 16 Milllion shorted today and a massive Short ratio, and I don't see them covering any time soon.  So the short squeeze story is there.  Also, most of those are a bunch of new paper handed boomer bears from Twitter shorting this, so that's an easy squeeze. As well, since we are now on the short restriction list, that's LITERALLY WHAT HAPPEND TO US.  They cant short, only close positions, similar to us not being able to buy.  (I think that's what that means?)

\-We have diamond hands, and we can remain stupid longer than they can remain solvent.  We have millions of people switching to fidelity and vanguard, and new members joining everyday to join the fight.  Even 1 diamond handed retard doing their part helps.  We gained 6 million people in a month.  If even 1 million of them each bought 1 share, and held.  At 100$ a share, that's alot of money and shares.  IDK math.  (100 Million dollars?).  It helps anyway.  This will ramp up, and just as we had some random paper hands on the way down, they will have paper hands on the way up.

\-We just got a whole bunch more people, at a whole lot cheaper price.  Sure, we have alot of people at 300 and 350, but we have ALOT of people.  Getting all these new people able to reload at 100$ a share is a godsend.  I doubled my shares on the way down, and will probably buy more as money clears.  Diamond hands are the way to go.  IF you are scared, don't want a loss, etc etc. It is literally so simple.  Buy, put in the highest sell order the brokerage will let you, and don't worry about it other than to buy more.  8 MILLION people even with 1000$ each, COULD LITERALLY BUY  GAMESTOP AT ITS CURRENT PRICE.  We already have an edge with people like DFV having .5% of gamestop.  I don't know what his plan is, but if it keeps dropping, and he decides to buy more, or exercise those options, that position will only grow. We have several millionaires in here as well buying and holding.  So, if you have 1-2 shares, they will help make up for it.

Bear Case:

\-Honestly, the only way we lose this is if you sell, or people lose confidence. Have a plan, don't doubt, stick to it, chin up, buy more, live life in the mean time."

**We’re heard all sorts of talk, many but not all being bots:**

- “The shorts have covered, it’s over”

- “I cashed out but sadly it was during last weeks premarket at 510 and not 515, you guys are retarded and should sell.”

- “I burned my house down for the insurance money and put it into GME along with my life savings at $450 and now I’m long rope.”

- “I sucked 185 dicks for 185 bucks and got 1 GME share today but then I sold because this is taking too long.”

**So to ease your minds I’ve taken the time to post [This Poll](https://strawpoll.com/crzhh7f7b/r) on WSB and found the median amount of shares owned by the average WSB user**

The data set ranges are a bit wide but for a median it works just fine and may actually be a bit of an underestimation. 

So, the number of shares the average WSB user owns? **8.** That may not seem like much but let’s just check out the number of new WSB users in recent times.

I checked [subreddit stats](https://subredditstats.com/r/Wallstreetbets) and saw that on Jan 23rd, we had about **2M** Redditors on WSB, today that number is over **8M**.

Now let’s be VERY generous and say 30% of the total number of users are actually bots, 10% lurkers, 10% with 0 shares.

Well then that means **4M X 8 Shares = 32M Shares**

🦍 🦍 🦍 **is in control of over 50% of the available shares.**

And let me make it just a bit more interesting...

**If those 4M holders theoretically bought 4 more shares each, we would own the available float on GameStop, and we could literally set our price with no room to fuck around. We would effectively own GameStop.**

**TL;DR: The average WSB user owns 8 shares, some math shows that’s about 32M shares out of about 47M Float**

I had some prior investment experience. Nothing too serious. I'm a frugal person who saves a lot. I've passively invested--in the most elementary of ways through a few stocks, Roths and IFs--but never took the dive to properly understand the market, its mechanisms, and its movements.

Over the past few weeks, I've gained some insights on these. But I have come to the full realization of just how little I knew. I've attempted to grasp too much too quickly, and had left myself holding a bag. I fell victim to the hype and prospect of gaining a stronger economic footprint amongst a pandemic-driven job market, and have lost about 15% of my net worth. Thankfully, I gambled money that wasn't necessary for bills or debts. Most of my emergency fund is gone, but that will come back soon enough.

What will remain is the cemented, constant caution of DD. The understanding that a core community, whitewashed by popularity, can generate momentum in which they aren't heeded. The reiteration that financial success in these markets is not one of kindness, altruism, or hand-holding.

For all the gaslighting, satire, and lulz, I hate you. But I also understand; you cannot continue to preach the truth when fanaticism dominates the discussion. I've been on the internet long enough to expect nothing less.

Thank you for creating this space. I will take my losses. I will **lurk**, **listen,** and **learn.**

I suggest you  🦍  do the same."

Gather around the fire place and let me tell you a story I once read upon the great great internet. It was about the Great Squeeze of 2021. In the cold nights of January when hedge funds of dubious morale had their asses handed to them by a bunch of apes with bananas and lust for a stonks. Dirty tricks were played by brokers and other establishments of Wall Street as they waged an ongoing struggle against the common man. This story starts as the struggle seemed lost for our brave apes with bananas.......

Screw it. Read it for yourself. And no I a not the author.

GameStop is falling. Whether the hedge funds covering is legal or not doesn’t matter. If it’s done illegally, they’ll get a slap on the wrist, a 1-10mil fine, and chalk it up as a net gain vs what they would have lost.

Robinhood and other brokers rigged the game against us, and that’s it. They might get a slap on the wrist, maybe some will have to remove certain features, but that’s it.

There won’t be a great retribution. There probably won’t be “justice”. Sometimes you just lose money. This is the danger of fomo and looking at the market as a get rich quick scheme. MOST people lose when they do this, only a few win, and usually you have to be in early enough to win anything substantial.

Sometimes being a retard pays off, but most of the time you just lose. There is almost never some some great conspiracy theory. Almost always it’s just an L.

GameStop ran up over 1000% in a month. It’s very likely we’ve already experienced the short squeeze. 

AMC issued 50million additional shares at the peak which essentially wiped out all short squeeze potential.

There is a ton of money to be made with our collective minds, but spending your energy justifying GameStop is not the way to make that money. If you genuinely think that the short sellers are not currently covering their positions at the prices over the past 2 days then you’re delusional. Take your emotions out of the market and you’ll make a lot more money.

You set your sights on the BANG stocks and finally found a way to hit Wall Street where it hurts. A win for the retail investor, one might say.  You were suddenly seeing more green in your portfolios than many of you could have ever hoped for and you were hitting the 🌈🐻 where it hurts, their pocketbook. 

Where you went wrong was taking that small victory and doing full blown retarded things to celebrate. Things like flying banners over robinhood, buying billboards, and just generally taking focus away from your goals and the path to them. You’ve poked the bear and now the bear has swiped back. 

Instead of going full retard, which Robert Downey Jr says you should never do, take these moments away from the market to self-improve. Learn to read, research financial topics, evaluate your past plays and the emotions involved, just do more than screeching at the hedge funds for such a small victory. Think about how you, the individual investor, can continue hitting the shorts and start showing the red on their balance sheets again.

1612307792.0,6834,Why GME is still in the game to trigger MOASS (MUST-READ BULLET POINTS),"Today was a crazy ride, and we've all been following the action the entire time. My opinion is that unless I can find compelling evidence that the squeeze is truly done for and off the table, my conviction has only grown stronger.

Most important things that stick out, all of which really build a case that must not be dismissed:

1) If shorts have covered, we should have noticed reasonable strong upwards momentum, as buying pressure consists of short covering along with retail buying, and a limited float.

2) Past few days we've seen trading volumes below average, likely suppressed demand caused by broker restrictions on buying. Lower volume can make any dump pull the price down easily. Especially when the demand side is getting locked out. Have to mention the timing of which Robinhood locked buying last week as well, coinciding with a massive dip.

3) Look at [this image](https://preview.redd.it/dralf2uks4f61.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=52223e916aacb4f65681da1cfe4f5e1ade7cea30)

Notice how AMC & GME have almost identical candlesticks, and the same is in the BB-NOK pair. It is undeniable that a lot of people are buying this stock and holding this stock. Not just in America but all across the world. We have global support.
You would think that with this many people in the trade (whether they are on the buying / selling side) we would see greater variance. This correlation to me looks like obvious manipulation by higher frequency and higher volume algorithmic trading.
It's hard to look at these charts and say that this is natural supply and demand. Seriously, same candlestick patterns on unrelated stocks. This price action is influenced by targeted manipulation to a high degree. Even if people were really selling off like crazy, wouldn't we see more natural candles?

4) We have mainstream media (MSM) covering the ""reddit mania"" extensively. MSM says reddit is trying to squeeze silver, which is false. You will not find anyone pushing to buy SLV on reddit. In fact, you will see a warning about silver and how many HFs have long positions in it.

5) We've seen an influx of bots on social media (reddit, FB, twitter) promoting silver, spamming that GME squeeze is finished, diverting attention away from the more uninformed audience. Why? If it's finished why the need for these?

6) MSM says the short squeeze mania is over and shorts have covered. If that is true, why are we seeing trade restrictions still on more and more brokers, and nonstop coverage all over TV and the internet. If it's over, why are there so many articles bashing retail to stay away?

7) GME is an outlier in the ""failed-to-deliver"" statistic, and has been put on NYSE short restriction (uptick rule). Something fishy is going on with the shares in the float.

8) SI% numbers are very conflicting. Especially the numbers that came around 30-50%. It was then later mentioned by someone in S3 that a different calculation was used. If you convert to the old calculation, you still get over 100% SI%. Why are they trying to change it all of a sudden?

To me, this is enough to say we're still in the game. If it's over, let them prove it by crushing GME to $20 and on February 9th we hear the official SI% being low. Then it's finished. Something tells me that it's not over, and this is all a ploy to mitigate the damage they are about to receive when GME eventually triggers the MOASS.

Can't say for sure it's a 100% trip to the moon and beyond, but what's really suggested otherwise? This whole misinformation campaign + price manipulation combo is too important to dismiss.

Remember I'm retard and please make your own financial decisions. This post is based on my observation and speculation.

**Harley Davidson DD- WILD HOGS🐖🚀🐖🚀**

WHO IS READY TO GO HOG WILD! Harley announced earnings and got spanked- no worries… we will go the moon.

If intellectually disabled (🐒) look at the TL;DR

**BULLISH SENTIMENT:**

Jochen Zeitz gives massive hope as a CEO and leader for HOG. The future is EV for the vehicle industry and motorcycles are no different. A niche market for powerful EV bikes has yet to be untapped and is what will push Harley Davidson into the future.

· he became CEO of Puma – making him the youngest ever CEO of a German company at the time – and turned the near-bankrupt business into one of the world's top three sports brands

· he now sits on the boards of Harley-Davidson, financial services company Cranemere, and the Kenya Wildlife Service, as well as running his own charitable foundation and co-chairing The B Team, a non-profit that he co-founded with Richard Branson in 2012 to promote sustainable business practices.

His previous ventures gave him a strong backing socially and experience with sustainable energy which is a must for Harley Davidson.

Touring and Large cruisers remain to be the biggest driver in profit and production for the company. Even through COVID-19 these remain steady. Introduction of their new bike, Pan-America Adventure Touring Motorcycle, is much more appealing to the younger crowd.

**ELECTRIC MOTORCYLES:**

Harley-Davidson is striving to be the leader in electric Motorcycles which will quickly set them apart from all other competitors and introduce a new segment of consumers for HOG. The executive staff is fully committed to a distinct product with go-to market strategies.

**BEARISH SENTIMENT:**

BOOMERS RIDE MOTORCYCLES XD

TLDR version: Cloud/email/data security. Huge growth, recent acquisition, fair value estimate showing ~50% upside, earnings in 2 weeks at which point the fair value will likely increase even further as the recurring revenues from acquisitions and the continued growth push the data averages higher.

Corsair IPO'ed in September at $17.00 and the stock went rocket rocket straight upto 30$+. The all time highs has been 50$ ish and is currently trading at 38$. They absolutely destroyed Q3 earnings and beat expectations in every department.   


**Here's some of the highlights of their Q3 earnings, Source :- globenewswire & their Q3 report.**

Net revenue was $457.1 million, an increase of 60.7% year-over-year. Segment net revenue was $161.6 million, an increase of 128.8% year-over-year. Gaming components and systems segment net revenue was $295.5 million, an increase of 38.3% year-over-year.

Gross profit was $127.9 million, an increase of 112.4% year-over-year, with gross margin of 28.0%, an improvement of 680 basis points year-over-year.

Operating income was $49.7 million, an increase of 353.6% year-over-year.

Adjusted operating income was $61.4 million, an increase of 193.7% year-over-year.

Net income was $36.4 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.5 million in the same period a year ago, or $0.02 per diluted share.

Adjusted net income was $48.5 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, an increase of 384.0% year-over-year compared to adjusted net income of $10.0 million, or $0.13 per diluted share.

Adjusted EBITDA was $63.7 million, an increase of 184.9% year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.9%, an improvement of 610 basis points year-over-year.

As of September 30, 2020, we had cash and restricted cash of $120.1 million, $48.0 million capacity under our revolving credit facility and total long-term debt of $370.1 million.

The stock ran from 21$ to 40$ after their Q3 earnings report so there should be no brainer that stock won't do the same again. **Like I already mentioned, that anything discussed on this DD is not an advice and its a personal opinion.**

$CRSR had a non-dilutive offering last week at $35 per share. This didn't add shares, just gave their initial PE firm a chance to cash out. With 7M shares sold at $35, this built a solid new ""floor"" for the stock on high volume at $35. Corsair has 36% short interest (obviously lower than GME), but the main IPO lock up period doesn't expire til March. Corsair's current available float is only 20% of total shares outstanding while short interest is 36%. Not a lot of shares available for shorts to cover if the stock starts moving against them.

&#x200B;

The Market Cap for this stock is \~3.31 B and their Revenue for Q4 is half of that? Insane. I'm likely expecting it to be way over the estimations above just like when they doubled expectations the quarter before. The floor for this is 35$ as shown by the past month and a half and It peaked at 51$.

1612306271.0,467,Meme stock post-mortem,"Throwing out some lessons-learned for everyone (especially the 6.2 million people who joined in the past two weeks).  Here's why shit went sideways for you:

**You didn't do your research:** GME (and to a lesser extent NOK/BBBY/BB) has been a work-in-progress for months.  This wasn't something organic and spontaneous; there was a very small window to catch the lightning.  Once in, you took the advice from random internet strangers who want you to buy/hold to increase the value of their positions.

**You FOMO'd:** If you knew about this before $100 and didn't jump, you probably should've sat it out.  If you found out about this after $100, you should have watched from the sidelines and taken notes for the next time.

**You didn't have a plan:** Sure, your spaceship emojis are cute but they're free and you can't buy anything with them in the real world.  If you're buying stocks, you're doing so with the intent to make money.  Money is only real when you sell.  Set a goal, stick to it (or make small adjustments; it's ok to change a goal as long as it's REASONABLE).  This includes taking profits and then, if you want, buying back in on a dip.

**You made it personal:** Stocks aren't your pets; they're fucking cattle.  Get what you can out of them and then move on.  You don't buy stocks to join a feel-good movement about sticking it to the <insert target group here> or because ""I like to company/stock"", you buy them to make money. 

**You made it a group activity:** Unless you're pooling resources and winnings, all these ""Ape"" comments are fucking retarded.  That's code for, ""please don't leave me I don't want to be the last one holding bags""

**You missed the obvious signs:** WSB goes dark and all the meme stocks collapse a the same time, that's a sign.  All of the meme stocks move in-sync, that's a sign (algos are in charge, not retail investors).

**You used money you couldn't lose:** This ties into the group mentality and DD where you just hopped on the bus without asking where it was going or how; NEVER spend money you can't afford to lose in the stock market -- there are no sure bets.

100% this will get removed by all the fucking idiots in this sub so do yourself a solid and copy/paste it for reference; hopefully it'll add value to your future endeavors.

If you made money in all of this, congrats; don't forget to put some aside for taxes."

I'm always willing to lose the money when Trading, thats the common denominator. But look at the upside. If this popped and I sold? **God damn, thats what I cant afford to lose**. I would never forgive myself.

I can pass up other trades, but TBH **reverse FOMO** in a big way. There is no way in HELL I am missing out on this.

What other trade can you be apart of with these stakes? Even if we lose the money, IT WILL BE THE BEST MONEY I EVER LOST.

**Why it is different.**

I remember a bunch of us on this sub saw the Coronavirus dip coming, It was called the beer virus and yeah, its never popular to be a 🌈🐻... Guess what? We made a lot of money. Guess who I told.... NO ONE.

We were up against billions of fund, trading platforms that we do not own or have a say in, our weapons, controlled by the enemy.

As I'm sure many of you who have been following the ""Counterfeit Shares"" theory about the various short attacks on $GME have seen, the SEC publishes lagged data on the cumulative number of Fails to Deliver for every company. If you aren't caught up with the latest info on the counterfeit share theory, take a second and read [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/)'s \[post\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the\_real\_reason\_wall\_street\_is\_terrified\_of\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)) laying out the issue with hedge funds counterfeiting shares and how it relates to GME. Much of the analysis in Johnny's post comes from an article \[""Counterfeiting Stock 2.0""\]([http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html)) which is definitely worth a read if you have the time and patience to do a deep dive into the evil shit carried out by hedge funds.

**TLDR of Johnny's post:** Hedge funds create a bunch of stock out of thin air and short it, selling the counterfeit shares on the open market and driving the price of a company down. They then fail to come up with the shares they sold in time, so the ""counterfeit"" shares are never backed up by real shares. This could be happening on a massive scale with GME, and Hedge Funds could have far greater exposure to GME than previously thought.

&#x200B;

**The Data:**

I noticed that while [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/) and later [u/Peteskies](https://www.reddit.com/user/Peteskies/) used data from the SEC releases in their posts, the data they actually showed was only a small piece, and lacked very important context. So, with that in mind, I took the SEC Fails-to-Deliver data \[releases\]([https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)) for both halves of November and December and the first half of January and took a look at what was going on using some pivot tables. I thought given the sheer amount of data (1.5 million cells) it would be tough to load in Excel but it actually ended up being pretty easy. (probably helped that my day job is just alternately making pivot tables and slamming my head into the wall, I've gotten pretty good at both)

IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS RELEASE EXTENDS TO JANUARY 14TH, 2021. THESE ARE NOT CURRENT CUMULATIVE OUTSTANDING FAIL-TO-DELIVER LEVELS

&#x200B;

**Fails-to-Deliver Distributions:**

First, take a look at this handy histogram(ish) of companies with outstanding Fails-to-Deliver and their outstanding ""counterfeit share"" (cumulative Fails-to-Deliver) numbers:

https://preview.redd.it/6dmfpfql47f61.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf38fea8f5de2e45b36b48853f4d7afaca8f6c28

As you can see, GME is way outside of the pack when it comes to Fail to Delivers, and has significantly more ""counterfeit shares"" (FTDs) than almost any other company. The exact number comes in at a cool 621,483 shares. The x-axis scale isn't even linear, and you can see significant jumps in the last quarter.

&#x200B;

If you think that's some crazy shit, wait until you see the distribution of Fail-to-Delivers per company by the dollar value of counterfeit shares ((Closing Price)\*(# of Outstanding Fails-to-Deliver)):

https://preview.redd.it/024mdiv147f61.png?width=1616&format=png&auto=webp&s=270fc53a5455994545a864e8b8e9c304b0e57b5c

GameStop has the SECOND HIGHEST Fails-to-Deliver net dollar value of all 5,147 stocks with current fail-to-delivers (as of 1/14/21). NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS of stock floating around that was simply created out of thin air. Here the x-axis isn't even linear either — if it were to scale, GME would be several meters to my right. Wild.

&#x200B;

**Cumulative Fails-to-Deliver of GME over Time:**

Moving on to more interesting (and potentially more troubling) data, I took a look at the Fails-to-Deliver values over time for GME. I decided to go back to the beginning of November, then look at every number the SEC had released since on FTDs for GME. This is crucial context for the numbers that have been thrown around by [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/) and [u/Peteskies](https://www.reddit.com/user/Peteskies/).

https://preview.redd.it/myt4zxy347f61.png?width=1328&format=png&auto=webp&s=603b5d5f0a623dc0dc9ef0df1f3da05e7361340f

Now, this one is a lot less clear-cut than those histograms I just wrote about. As you can see, there have been huge fluctuations in the amount of ""counterfeit stock"" (Fails-to-Deliver) on the market. There is a definite pattern of Hedge Funds running up Fails-to-Deliver during GME surges and then covering once the price slumps a bit. I've talked with one of my sources involved with hedge fund operations, and he said this is pretty standard procedure — when you sell a naked short and the price spikes, you talk it out with your broker and get a few more days to cover. So really, this pattern is more or less normal. It's the stupidly large amounts Fails-to-Deliver that are getting churned that is the irregular part.

Here's a good spot to bring up my main concern with the kind of analyses that [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/) and [u/Peteskies](https://www.reddit.com/user/Peteskies/) were putting out. You can see that there were 1.8 million Fails-to-Deliver on GME on December 2nd, but that number was basically completely covered by the 16th. Based on that data it seems at first glance that, for the most part, these reported Fails-to-Deliver are Hedge Funds/Brokers trying to avoid covering while high and simply waiting for the next dip. This data alone IS NOT SUFFICIENT to prove that there is an enormous, market-moving quantity of Fails-to-Deliver floating around the market. Of course, right after this data cuts out, GME shoots to the moon (300+), and I would expect a lot of naked short vendors were caught with their pants down. Maybe they all covered on the recent dips, maybe loads of Fails-to-Deliver are still out there.

A table with that GME info from the graph above for any lurking nerds:

https://preview.redd.it/0pj2hh0647f61.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcf2d64f6777218dece7735075b779fb51e28cca

&#x200B;

**Some Questionable Inferences and My Retarded Conclusions:**

So, what's the takeaway here, other than don't trust everything you read on WallStreetBets? I think there are a few lessons. First, even though Fails-to-Deliver numbers were bouncing all over the place, including being completely covered on 12/16, I think it's important to keep in mind that GME having this volume of Fails-to-Deliver, both in shares and in dollars, is extremely irregular compared to everything else. Could just be the fact that GME is an insane stock with insane volatility,\* or could be indicative of something more.

*\*Yet, this data is from back before GME became mainstream — GME in December was not an ""unprecedented situation"" like we have now. Thinking back to then, the high Fails-to-Deliver numbers are even more significant.*

&#x200B;

**A Possibility of Hedge Fund Armageddon:**

I want to take a second to talk about one of the diagrams from the good folks who wrote \[""Counterfeiting Stock 2.0""\]([http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html)), detailing both the ""surface level"" indicators of Disclosed Shorts and Fails-to-Deliver, and the below-the-surface hidden pathways that they believed pumped counterfeit shares into our financial system. Here it is:

https://preview.redd.it/v3io9bj847f61.jpg?width=1086&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21d67bbec3d7d4e3b2012b3d51cdaf462ae3318d

As you can see, the Counterfeiting 2.0 authors believed that Fails-to-Deliver were just the tip of the iceberg. Below the surface (and out of the sight of the SEC), they believed there was a massive volume of shares that had been ""laundered,"" through foreign exchanged, offshore funds, or even gaps in the Continuous Net Clearing system at the DTCC. These stocks, theoretically, go from Fails-to-Deliver to simple counterfeit shares, or even straight to counterfeits. The arguments in the Counterfeiting 2.0 paper go way over my head as a simple retard, but I get the gut feeling at least some of them are accurate.

If, hypothetically, (please read this part in your best Ben Shapiro voice), the arguments in Counterfeiting 2.0 are true, then it is highly likely that the huge Fails-to-Deliver churn on the surface is just the tip of a massive illegal counterfeit short position. GME BULLS, listen up. If this counterfeit short position does exist, then it was probably entered back when GME was being driven towards bankruptcy, at a share price somewhere in the $15/20 range, and possibly expanded when GME was being driven down below $5. There are actually interesting data to suggest that this is a plausible scenario. First, the fact that, as [/u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/) noted a year ago, the market cap of GME was driven below the net value of its assets. Obviously, this happens from time to time, but it's indicative of an extremely artificially depressed valuation. Secondly, the central use of illegal naked shorting is in driving companies to bankruptcy, and it did seem like GME was on its way out. Looking at GME as a scummy hedge fund manager, it would have made a very attractive target for a naked-short dilution attack.

These illegal short positions, if they were not covered by cautious (lol) Hedgies at the beginning of the GME runup, would have increased 50-100x in dollar value as the share price of GME rose. That's 5,000-10,000% for those who can't do basic math. Now I don't know if this scenario would be enough to crash the market, but it would certainly be enough to make a lot of extremely powerful people (currently engaged in a criminal enterprise) desperate and very, very angry. This hardly needs saying, but rich bastards have killed for far less than a billion dollars. Here, there could be tens of billions on the line.

So, that's the mega-bull case. We, the tards of WSB, expose billions in financial crime. The SEC rappels into Citadel and arrests everyone, Robinhood goes bankrupt, and all our wives and their boyfriends get filthy rich. However, there is also a very significant BEAR case here. If the regular, everyday investors who wrote Counterfeiting 2.0 were in fact retards like us, then there's a significant chance that they simply got it wrong. Maybe there is no sea of hidden counterfeit short positions, and maybe this whole Fails-to-Deliver thing is just rich assholes using extra trading days to cheaply sell shorts. What then? In that case, I would bet my left nut that all of the outstanding Fails-to-Deliver have been covered in the recent slump, and this whole exciting report is largely irrelevant to the future performance of GME.

I'm not going to make the case that either the bulls or the bears are right (even though my gut is with the bulls) because I simply don't have the information or mental capacity to make that call. Look at the data yourself, and draw your own conclusions. Retail is facing an enemy with more capital, more information, more experience, and fewer morals. Whichever way it goes, it's going to be an ugly fight.

&#x200B;

Positions: 12 shares (Bought 50 at $20, sold 50 at $250, bought back in 12 at $300). I plan to hold until either $4,000 a share or things go to shit.

&#x200B;

I am not a financial advisor, and I do not advise any readers to make financial decisions based on my opinions or the information presented in this report.

&#x200B;

# TLDR: the cumulative Fails-to-Deliver volume on GME is massive compared to the rest of the market. However, is also extremely volatile, and small compared to the float. It is possible that high Fails-to-Deliver volume is a result of massive illegal share counterfeiting by shorts.

In the past week, the enemy has done a mighty good job of making this stock look less appealing. We need to counter it by making people want this stock. We can't just like it. We must LOVE it and make OTHERS LOVE it. We need to remind everyone of the mission and what's at stake. Even if it doesn't squeeze, if we just keep buying the stock, it will go up. And nothing will bring on the squeeze more than the price going up.

Most DD for GameStop is full of groupthink assertments, and some even misinforming those who don't know better that something that may never happen is certain to occur within whatever timeframe.

Is there any precedent to what we are up against?

2. What do we stand to gain at this point? How long do we have to hang tight?
If the shares are not being bought by us but instead by hedge funds... then won’t they be able to recycle the shares enough times to escape at a reduced cost and there will be no squeeze? I’m a retard so I don’t quite fully get this, but people’s comments make me think this is possible. 

3. How can WSB lift the facts up and not just what we want to hear? The sub is so saturated now as I mentioned above. How can we focus on pushing this event to the finish line? We need to unify. I moved my other meme stock positions to GME to fortify the line. 

4. At the very least we had fun doing it, right? I’ve had fun. Gonna keep battling with you tards. Never play with more than you can afford to lose.

&#x200B;

 

Fellow Amazonians:

I’m excited to announce that this Q3 I’ll transition to Executive Chair of the Amazon Board and Andy Jassy will become CEO. In the Exec Chair role, I intend to focus my energies and attention on new products and early initiatives. Andy is well known inside the company and has been at Amazon almost as long as I have. He will be an outstanding leader, and he has my full confidence.

This journey began some 27 years ago. Amazon was only an idea, and it had no name. The question I was asked most frequently at that time was, “What’s the internet?” Blessedly, I haven’t had to explain that in a long while.

Today, we employ 1.3 million talented, dedicated people, serve hundreds of millions of customers and businesses, and are widely recognized as one of the most successful companies in the world.

How did that happen? Invention. Invention is the root of our success. We’ve done crazy things together, and then made them normal. We pioneered customer reviews, 1-Click, personalized recommendations, Prime’s insanely-fast shipping, Just Walk Out shopping, the Climate Pledge, Kindle, Alexa, marketplace, infrastructure cloud computing, Career Choice, and much more. If you get it right, a few years after a surprising invention, the new thing has become normal. People yawn. And that yawn is the greatest compliment an inventor can receive.

I don’t know of another company with an invention track record as good as Amazon’s, and I believe we are at our most inventive right now. I hope you are as proud of our inventiveness as I am. I think you should be.

As Amazon became large, we decided to use our scale and scope to lead on important social issues. Two high-impact examples: our $15 minimum wage and the Climate Pledge. In both cases, we staked out leadership positions and then asked others to come along with us. In both cases, it’s working. Other large companies are coming our way. I hope you’re proud of that as well.

I find my work meaningful and fun. I get to work with the smartest, most talented, most ingenious teammates. When times have been good, you’ve been humble. When times have been tough, you’ve been strong and supportive, and we’ve made each other laugh. It is a joy to work on this team.

As much as I still tap dance into the office, I’m excited about this transition. Millions of customers depend on us for our services, and more than a million employees depend on us for their livelihoods. Being the CEO of Amazon is a deep responsibility, and it’s consuming. When you have a responsibility like that, it’s hard to put attention on anything else. As Exec Chair I will stay engaged in important Amazon initiatives but also have the time and energy I need to focus on the Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, The Washington Post, and my other passions. I’ve never had more energy, and this isn’t about retiring. I’m super passionate about the impact I think these organizations can have.

Amazon couldn’t be better positioned for the future. We are firing on all cylinders, just as the world needs us to. We have things in the pipeline that will continue to astonish. We serve individuals and enterprises, and we’ve pioneered two complete industries and a whole new class of devices. We are leaders in areas as varied as machine learning and logistics, and if an Amazonian’s idea requires yet another new institutional skill, we’re flexible enough and patient enough to learn it.

Keep inventing, and don’t despair when at first the idea looks crazy. Remember to wander. Let curiosity be your compass. It remains Day 1.

Jeff"

I've borrowed and dumbed down this chart from [this savant's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l97jbo/gamestop_big_picture_market_mechanics/).

As the free-flowing stock dries up (due to ppl buying and holding), the volatility increases. It becomes easier and easier to move the needle with less money. As long as you keep holding and buying, the volatility will only increase. **Expect huge swings in the next few days.**

Hedge funds know this. They tanked the stock this morning. Right now they intentionally leveling the demand to keep the stock price stable; to make it look like the ride is over.

HOWEVER

The short float is still high, and the [volume has been steadily decreasing](https://i.imgur.com/eRH3S2b.png).

Furthermore, [institutional ownership](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings) only picked up about 12m shares, and some of those went to institutions that were long not short. Now maybe I'm misreading this, or maybe they're fudging the data, but I just don't see how the shorts covered their position with this measly volume.

|ACTIVE POSITIONS|HOLDERS|SHARES|
|:-|:-|:-|
|New positions|46|12,880,726|
|Sold out positions|34|3,412,841|

\--

Keep in mind the VW squeeze happened with far less short-interest than is currently in GME. The main problem is that retail investors, unlike huge firms, can't vacuum up all the supply fast enough, which enables the hf to slowly wiggle their way out buying up paper hands. They've likely exited their worst short positions and reshorted at a better price.

Some people are saying the squeeze might be more of a slow gradual upward pressure, rather than a sudden event. The truth is that the hedge funds are walking on a tightrope, and this stock is still extremely volatile. Any big movements in demand can drastically impact the price.

\------

Disclaimer: I am a poker player, not a day trader.  In poker, this is what we call an ""implied odds play"". The risk is relatively small for us bulls (relative to the short position), but the expected value is potentially huge if it works.  But these plays are still risky despite being +EV. **You have to be prepared to ride the swings and embrace the variance.**

*This is pure, uneducated speculation, not financial advice.*

**TL/DR: Grit your teeth and brace for swings. Shit's about to get nuts.**

This is a perspective post. You'll get your gd rockets in the end. 

Pump the brakes. Stop living in the moment every 20mins over and over again. Zoom out, gather yourself, have some perspective. 

I was GLUED to my screens the last few weeks, watching, gathering, celebrating, maddening—but this last week has taught me a lot. The stock price and fluctuation, in this scenario, is not attached to what's really happening. **YOU KNOW THIS.** Now stop panicking when you know they're fucking with you. We've learned that the free market economy, that we've been encourage to take part in, is not all rainbows and roses. What we do know is they're illegally manipulating the price, but it will catch up to them. VOLUME IS NOT MATCHING PRICE SWINGS. 

There's amazing DD done after the markets are closed. Dig around and look for those, they'll give you all the reassurance you need. While the markets are open, that's when the snakes strike. They're tanking the price, the news is infiltrating your brain, you think of losses. But it's all synthetic. 

You need to take care of yourself and be stoic. People who are dropping out and acting out of emotion and instinct, not confidence and understanding. Take a look at our lord and savior, DFV's Twitter: [https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty). There's no panic, no short-term thinking, just fucking swag. He posts kitten gifs and his positions at the end of each trading day. His balls are swelling beyond the size of the moon. That's confidence. He's lost tens of millions in theoretical value this last week, and yet he's stoic. What does that tell you? What does he know that you don't? Find the DD at the end of the days. Look at volume vs price swings. 

This isn't supposed to make sense if you've been following the market for some time now. You'll see your favorite youtube stock investors starting to cave under the pressure because they're still associating the stock price with gains/losses. They are focused on likes, follows, subscribers and that's amplified by big jumps in stock price; of course they'll feel defeated. But OG investors will always tell you that the longer you hold the better off you'll be. You think Warren Buffett threw a party every time Coca Cola went up 5% in a day? No, he was thinking 10-20 years out. We're in a different league now. The rules you once knew aren't applying but there are some underlying truths you have to know, deeply. After that you'll feel so much better. 

Sure we're down 60% today, but I'm feeling better today than I have all week. Because I know something. I invite you to see the truth through all the noise. 

Here are some major resources that have calmed me down. Look to the horizon my friends.

[https://imgur.com/a/zuc7aUL](https://imgur.com/a/zuc7aUL)

However, if you look at the image, it says the trigger date is 2/1 and the proposed deactivation date is 2/3... doesn't that mean the restriction started yesterday, and will actually end today? Is there another meaning for ""Trigger date"" and ""Deactivation date""? If someone could clarify what these two mean that would be helpful.

Everything’s that the hedgefunds have done since we beat them on AMC and GME last Wednesday is manipulate the market and tank the stock. The general consensus is that what has been going on is illegal stock price manipulation and the SEC has done nothing to protect retail stock buyers. 

I’m not saying someone should, but the SEC isn’t doing their job and we are paying the price for their negligence. Someone should hold them accountable, only way I see the people can do that is by suing them and holding tight until the Suits stop cheating, cuz we beat them and they’re salty.

We need to hold strong, nobody said this battle will be easy or that it was going to be won in one week. 
The media put the spotlight on silver to diverge the attention we were getting. We were 2 million last week now we are 8 million. We have grown in numbers and I’m sure among us are some spies and trolls and just curios people. But I am certain that we will prevail. We need to hold the $100 line tomorrow and get it back to $200 by Friday, the hedgefucks and their boyfriends will have to do some buying in order to cover. 
It is mathematically impossible that they have covered from 130% short interest to just 30% that’s fucking impossible. 
1) Up until Friday the short interest had rather increased
2) I know for sure they didn’t fucking trade over the weekend 
3) Retail investors, we are holding a big chunk of those stocks 

Wake up ! They are trying to make us surrender, it is impossible that they have covered their positions between Friday and today. 

Let’s hold the line, let’s get it back to $200-$300 levels. 

We might have taken the short ladder down but we will take the elevator going up.

DO NOT LET THOSE BASTARDS WIN, WE MUST REMAIN STRONG AND UNITED. THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING US. 

This is our legacy, we are being part of the history of investing and finance. We can be remembered as the ones who stood up against the big guy and won. 

We owe this to everyone who has lost before and has had their dreams crushed by the suits.

“How a DAO could take the GME case to a different level

 While it may rather seem to be a post for r/ethtrader, this is a post in which I try to make the case for how a DAO could supercharge what [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) did with GME: a collaborative attack on a billion Dollar hedgefund.

I didn't know wallstreetbets before the short squeeze of the GameStop stock and as many people I had to read into what was actually happening. Skimming through media reports the narrative seemed to be plain and simple ""Reddit rascals tricking Wallstreet suits"". However, if you follow the topic closely on Reddit, you can clearly see that for some people including [u/deepfuckingvalue](https://www.reddit.com/u/deepfuckingvalue/) (I highly recommend to check out this post on [r/video](https://www.reddit.com/r/video/) featuring his original analysis) this was neither a get-rich-quick scheme nor some joke. People really liked the idea to have the hedgefunds by the balls.

I personally don't think that this sentiment will eventually last (although I hope to be proved wrong). There may be even more people on the Subreddit claiming to hold with diamond hands, however overall there is a lack of proof that people DID hold, contributing to an increasing lack of trust - because people don't know for sure what the majority plans to do or is already doing, people lose the ability to act as a collective.

Now, dealing with a lack of trust even in an environment where people are highly suspicious of each other is somewhat the core feature of cryptocurrencies. A DAO that is able to buy stocks based on the vote of a group of people would allow investors to not only join forces but also to effectively eradicate the prisoners' dilemma that GME stock holders currently experience. This provides retail users with unprecedented powers.

Of course, joining forces is possible for everyone, retail users and bankers - but the wallstreetbets case shows that in the end a viral social media movement can be pretty powerful, at least relatively. The people who would join forces by adding funds to a DAO gain mutual trust and the ability to share risk, but they likewise share the gains and by doing so reduce them heavily. This makes it much less attractive for those who are mainly interested in multiplying investments short-term - people with a political agenda (flip the bird to Wallstreet) won't see this as a problem..

What would be needed is a DAO with a bridge to the stock market. Not as easy, but still possible in the very near future. I am half-sure, we might see this of solution within the next year.”"

A TON of action in options expiring on Friday. I suspect short-sellers are writing these PUTs and selling them to retail investors trying to cash in on the tank from their short-ladder attacks. At the same time, people (most likely hedge funds) are buying a large amount of calls also expiring on Friday.

Well, I’ve spent some time learning about what a short squeeze is, and how the hedgies are doing whatever they can to pull the price down as much as possible because their losses are currently staggering, even now.

This thing ain’t done. The short interest hasn’t gone down. The squeeze, as they say, ain’t been squoze.

Seeing what I’ve seen and knowing what I now know and watching you retarded 💎 🙌 hold on for dear life, suffering what looks like the worst losses I’ve ever fuckin seen (except for melvin’s; zing), well I’m back in.
