Just out of curiosity to be honest.,"Hear me out - I'm a known retard amongst my friends so it wouldn't be the first time I'm sent back to the kiddie table while the adults in the other room are having intercourse with my mom and wife. However, I AM a nosy whippersnapper.

If we all post it at the same format excluding cost basis then someone smarter can come and extra that this number.

I propose the format as following: 

1. Your insults to me come first

2. Your meme numbers of ""69"", ""420"" come after

3. Finally you post your shares (exclude the quotes) "">860"". I only know xls data separation b a specific mark so that's why I propose the "">"" sign, but as stated firstly - im a known retard",latoyj,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0CF26B08>
3,2021-02-02 12:44:24.568609,Bellweirboy,Financial Times deleting comments. Very unusual. Someone BIG must be leaning on them.,"So I wandered to the FT out of interest today. Top of the ‚ÄòMost Read‚Äô is this

Silver price hits 8-year high as retail traders take aim

Opened it up. Comments have been closed. Unusual for FT. Only happens in politically controversial pieces. Like BLM, Antifa, LGBT stuff. Several comments saying ‚Äòwhy was my comment deleted / referred to moderator‚Äô. 

Then went to this: No 5 of ‚ÄòMost Read‚Äô

Robinhood‚Äôs aim to ‚Äòdemocratise finance‚Äô collides with Wall St reality. 

Made a comment about the role of DTCC/NSCC & Cede Corporation. With a link to an article on illegal naked short selling, creation of counterfeit shares. Then I wrote that #silversqueeze was maybe originally a well-meaning genuine DD on WSB, but has since been disowned. Pointed out the mysterious way silver has been plugged wall to wall across the media. Suggested if the FT were embarrassed about their silver article and stung by the reader comments to it, they should just remove it, not close comments.   


My post was removed. No feedback, no trace. So I submitted a comment saying this was bad. ‚ÄòReferred to moderator‚Äô. I have been around FT a long time using trial accounts and 3 free articles per month. Never seen this. Never. Not for no bad language, even criticism of FT: they normally take it on the chin. Bizarre.

After reading this, I sent my broker an email telling them to grow a pair and fight the clearing firms next time.

My broker responded that the clearing firms shut down trading for **3.5 hours**: *the same duration as what TradeZero claims to have remained on the phone*. So trade zero shut down trading for the exact same amount of time as all the other brokers, and is just acting like Dan Pipitone stayed on the phone with them for 3 hours fighting this shit.

**Response from my Broker after Asking Them to Grow a Pair**

Thanks for reaching out, happy to help clarify. ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãOur clearing firm's decision to shut down trading for 3.5 hours on those stocks was for a capital call and had nothing to do with market manipulation. They do NOT trade for themselves or against customers. It is highly unlikely that our clearing firm will need to take similar actions on these stocks in the near-term future. This is a regulatory issue that is causing most of the clearing firms to not be able to meet the regulatory capital requirements. It has nothing to do with the brokerages or the liquidity providers. If the clearing firms cannot meet the regulatory capital requirements to accommodate for the risk associated with these symbols, they are forced to take action to reduce the risk and get back into compliance with the capital requirements. This was not a decision made by tastyworks. You can voice your displeasure to the regulators and the capital requirements that they put in place and enforce.

6,2021-02-02 12:44:25.246483,Ollerus-Gaming,Referencing the VW Short Squeeze in the GME timeline.,"Obviously the past couple of days have been slightly rocky and not pretty to look at. But a similar trend was followed right before the VW 'mother of all' short squeeze's in 2008 (link below, scroll down to the charts).

This happened right before the VW spike and is where I believe us to be right now. 

To simplify:

* Everyone shorted the ordinary VW shares expecting a drop due to the spread with the preferential shares (this doesn't apply exactly to GME but gives context to the rise in shorting)
* The ordinary share price continued to increase
* Deciding the ordinary VW share price had climbed as high as it could (last week for GME), funds increased shorting
* It seemed as though the fundamentals were catching up and the price dropped  
* Funds sized up on their shorts on the way down (12% of all shares sold were short)

What happened next:

* Over the weekend Porsche announced they basically owned 74.1% of the shares
* Lower Saxony had a 20% holding 
* Leaving 6% left. **This is what holding causes**
* 12% of the shares outstanding were sold short
* Meaning it was mathematically impossible for every short seller to close their position
* Shorts rushed to cover their positions, leaving half of them unable to, rocketing the price

If you're holding, do your own DD and understand why. This helped me see where this could lead.

**TL;DR:**

**Shorts have to cover eventually and there won't be enough shares to go around.**

9,2021-02-02 12:44:26.047117,YggdrasilBurnes,"I have some pretty grave concerns about the SEC's announcement of surplus stocks, alongside the 120% float.","Obligatory ü¶çüíéüëêGMEüöÄüåï. 

Okay. Real talk. 

120% float that has potential for Infinite Squeeze gains? 
FUCKING AWESOME.
30 million shares potentially jeopardizing everything?
NOT AWESOME.

Recently, there's been information suggesting that there may be 30 million more shares of GME on the market then were ever existing to begin with. This worries me because it's not a situation I've heard about before. I know about short selling, the short Squeeze that apparently is due for GME in the coming weeks, spanning across an uncertain amount of time. 

'But Volkswagen did the same thing, right?'

No. A lot of the references to Volkswagen here omit that Volkswagen took months to return to it's true value after the Squeeze, that happened rather suddenly, in a time without computerized trading, and was under non-suspect conditions. This was in a situation where 20 percent of the shares were owned by the US government, and 70 percent were just owned by not-the-short-sellers, so only 10 percent of the shares were up for grabs. Volkswagen didn't make more, and more didn't just explode into circulation like GME has apparently managed to do. It's a short Squeeze, sure, but it's a very different situation.

According to the SEC, not only was there an overshort of shares for GME, 120%, roughly 40% more than Volkswagen, but there were officially 30 million more shares in circulation than were ever produced by GameStop. Shares that didn't exist were overshorted by short sellers.

So, from my understanding, we have a potentially infinite short squeeze involving shares of GME that don't exist and that nobody can know who is holding. This feels like a recipe for disaster, but for who?

(THIS IS ALL SPECULATION FROM HERE, DO YOUR DD.)

My questions:

What does this imply for us? What would it mean to a Margin Acct like Robinhood or any previously made-Margin Accts in other Brokers? What would it mean for Cash Accts as well? Does this even take into account fractional shares, exclusive to Margin Accts?

My worries: 

In this situation, if I understand correctly, even in the best case scenario, $69420.00 a share for GME like everyone keeps memeing about, holding to such a ludicrous Squeeze, eventually, those synthetic shares will have to be corrected. Unless GameStop matches the 30 million shares themselves, which has it's own issues, then these shares will need to be corrected from the market somehow, or we'd end up in a stalemate. It'd be a Mexican standoff.

I was, and still am, all in for GME with what I'm risking. I sold a TSLA share and a Vanguard Dividend ETF to go all in. But: if the end result is my entire portfolio gets reclaimed to correct the synthetic stock that none of us were aware of til now, along with everyone else's, I'd like to know in advance. This seems like a ridiculous scenario, but it's reality. This entire situation is simply unprecedented. It can't even be considered a Black Swan because the only hindsight we could have would be DFV catching the short in his own time and buying. Hedge Fund shorting is all we could have had to go on. We could never forsee an illicit surplus of shares involved. 

This could be a fucking Venti-Black Swan scenario. What that entails is up in the air, but new scenarios means new procedures to approach them, and I don't think they'll go in our favor.

As much as I do actually believe in the ludicrous gains predicted right now, and I do hope (not blindly expect) to manually sell at $69420.00 or near it, I don't believe they'll even let all of us cash out with literal counterfeiting involved. Even DFV would be under these restrictions, if not the most damaged, since there's no way I know of to decipher who is holding illicit stock besides completely scouring the entire trade history of GME to their point of conception, and even then, it doesn't answer who's holding it now. Only where it started.

Am I missing something/inccorect somewhere, or are we in serious fucking trouble and just don't know it yet? Every day brings new information, new questions, and an unknowable amount of risk for GME. Part of me wants to believe us retail retards won't suffer the full brunt, but looking at the situation hype-free... It genuinely intimidates me. I may not be the most practiced trader, but I'm not some ignorant first-timer. I know nothing like this has happened in the entire history of of the market.

I don't expect any genuine financial advice from crayon eating retards watching their wives get railed day and night by 7'2 Black Gentlemen name De'Von, so feel free to blubber vaguely stock related nonsense in response. I just like the stock, but I don't know what even is the stock anymore. This is absolutely loony.

Oh, and before I forget,

My position: 

I'm currently 3.96 on GME, through Robinhood. I bought around $299ish and I have not initiated any transfer or placed any limits since. Have not sold to buy back dips, I figured that would do severe damage to the float percent we're trying to keep in Infinite squeezing range. I have no options. A 10.17 deficit was placed on my account at the time this went onto the news, which further convinced me to remain holding these shares on the account. Most every other broker is Cash Accts on sign up and this would potentially classify as a violation, though being Margin, even this is up for debate. That said, 20 dollars is transferring now to pay it off, so it might not even be relevant.

Not financial advice, influence, or recommendations of any kind. I am not a financial advisor, nor a financial expert of any kind. I just like the stock. I think. Maybe.",latknl,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0CFA44F0>
