This month I have learned that the world we are living in is rigged. I have learned that the media that I was watching before are lying. I have learned that there are almost no consequences to market manipulation as it is cheaper to pay fines then actually lose. 
I think as a community we have learned so much more about the financial system and who is and who is not on retail investor’s side. 

I could never have imagined that the media can be so easily manipulated. Today’s news about the silver got me laughing good when I first saw it, but then I started to get worried. This kind of manipulation is hard to withstand, especially for small investors like us. A stock dropping from 350 to 188 is worrisome. 

However it means only one thing, and it is that they are on their last days of existence. I have no idea what more shady manipulation they will come up with. But one thing is for sure, If everyone hold, there is just no way that they will be able to win it. I don’t care how much they manipulate us, how much they are paying others to say things. The only thing I care about now is that they lose and we win. They have not closed their positions, they have lost half of what they own. Think about stepping into their shoes, think about losing cars, yachts, wealth generally that everyday normal people will never have. I would for sure do anything in my power so that normal people would not take it all away from me. Think about how bad they will look for the rest of their lives if they loose to a bunch of retards on a Internet forum, they will not only loose money, but clients too. 

What I am trying to say is that it is up to you now. It can even take a bit longer then we anticipated. However if you sell, you will loose, and if you loose other normal people will loose, and if normal people will loose then the wealthy hedge funds and wealthy greedy people will win. I could cash out now and still make about 300 percent, I have been thinking about it. I came to a conclusion that being retarded is what makes us so strong. I don’t give a fuck about small amount of money, I want to cash out big time, over 1000 USD per share big time. I want everyone of you to look at the Volkswagen chart when it squeezed. How many days it took, and how low it fell before that happened. If GameStop falls to 100 so be it, if it falls even lower, SO BE IT. you are in control, the only way out for them now is that everyone will just get tired of this and sell. 
We could win big time here, we could tell this story years to come, sitting in the bars, sitting with our kids, sitting with our friends, and sitting here together. A community where people from all over the world came together and fucked over some wealthy dicks that feed on normal people like us. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀💎🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎

6,2021-02-02 00:22:41.018131,NHNE,💎🙌Comprehensive GME Diamond Hand Strategy Guide💎🙌," “If you **know** the **enemy** and **know** yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you **know** yourself but not the **enemy**, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you **know** neither the **enemy** nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.”  - Sun Tzu

We're in a war with the hedge funds and with wallstreet and basically the root of corruption in America with our GME short squeeze proxy war, and if you autists want to win this war, you need to know the enemy, and know yourself.   
Firstly, education is KEY, so if you're new, you DEFINITELY need to go learn at least what a short squeeze is and a short ladder attack is.   


What the enemy is doing: 

1. ***Price manipulation:*** With short ladder attacks, they use high frequency trading to make the price artificially lower.   
[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4pji/gme\_volume\_still\_low\_with\_positive\_cmf\_which/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4pji/gme_volume_still_low_with_positive_cmf_which/)  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la5upr/dont\_panic\_and\_just\_look\_at\_the\_fucking\_volume/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la5upr/dont_panic_and_just_look_at_the_fucking_volume/)  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laak53/for\_those\_of\_you\_getting\_scared\_look\_at\_that\_tiny/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laak53/for_those_of_you_getting_scared_look_at_that_tiny/)  
This can be seen with sizeable price movements that have tiny amounts of volume. There are several reasons why they are doing this:
   1. Scare off paper hand bitches: They prey on people who jumped on GME without even knowing what a short squeeze is; they see price fall, they paper hands and they get out.   
[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6vcb/wall\_street\_plan\_trying\_to\_psychologically\_scare/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6vcb/wall_street_plan_trying_to_psychologically_scare/)
   2. Make it cheaper for them to cover their more costly short positions. 
   3. Price manipulation will fail ultimately because while they are able to drive prices lower with their short attacks, when they eventually have to cover their short positions and buy, they will again drive prices up due to purchases of almost none existing stock (cuz we be holding), sending prices up as high as before they shorted or even higher. All the while hedge funds will continue to eat fees and interest on their short positions, making this cycle not doable indefinitely.   
[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7bhj/gme\_mms\_have\_until\_tomorrow\_22\_to\_buy\_shares\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7bhj/gme_mms_have_until_tomorrow_22_to_buy_shares_it/)
2. ***Media manipulation***
   1. Most if not all American main stream media is clearly serving corporate and wallstreet interests, simply by the false narratives they are reporting.   
[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1022/hmmm/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1022/hmmm/)  
They are not to be trusted and if seen, can dishearten and shake the will of those who don't have diamond hands. Best to avoid if you are a paper handed bitch. Some examples of false narratives are:
      1. Reddit is made up of alt-rights, or idiots, or gamblers, etc. -> We're not idiots, because we're the ones who were able to grab wallstreet by the nutsack. We're retards and autists who love the stock and the company. That is all. 
      2. Reddit is moving on to silver. -> SILVER CANNOT BE SQUEEZED!!!!! With a market cap of more than $1.5 Trillion, there is NO WAY for retail investors to be able to make a dent in that. The only possible short squeeze play is GME because it's a small cap company with a market cap of only $250 million as of July 2020, so it is definitely doable for a bunch of retards on WSB to affect the price of a small cap company stock. Literally all the posts on reddit promoting SLVR are from bot accounts that have sus creation dates and karma and post counts. Plus, Citadel owns a giant amount of silver so silver prices going up higher is gonna benefit them and give them more fuel to fight this GME war. You're shooting yourself int eh foot if you buy SLVR. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1xhf/guess\_who\_owns\_tonnes\_of\_slv\_options\_fuck\_citadel/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1xhf/guess_who_owns_tonnes_of_slv_options_fuck_citadel/)
      3. ""XXX IS THE NEXT GME"" -> This is also a false narrative. NOTHING can be the next GME, because NOTHING is shorted as much as GME, which is STILL over 100% shorted. GME IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY GAIN FOR US, AND LOSS FOR THEM!
      4. Shorts have covered their position. -> Another false narrative. Short interest is still over at 100%, and there are multiple WSB posts that explain this. Another metric that correlates to short interest is cost of borrowing for opening short positions, which would increase if it is harder to find shares to short.   
[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7d94/no\_more\_shares\_to\_short/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7d94/no_more_shares_to_short/)  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laaai8/gme\_short\_interest\_is\_currently\_sitting\_at\_12297/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laaai8/gme_short_interest_is_currently_sitting_at_12297/)  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5d6sk/gme\_short\_interest\_increased\_to\_7141m\_after\_jan/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5d6sk/gme_short_interest_increased_to_7141m_after_jan/)
3. ***Breaking the law:*** Some if not all of the things posted above are pretty much border line illegal, but there has been clear signs of breaking the law and market manipulation, IE: freeze buying of select stocks and only allow for selling. They can spin it however they want, but as far as I know, it has been unprecedented for a majority of brokerages to simultaneously alter the way a stock can be traded with cash. And if the situation is desparate enough, they'll break the law again and again if it ends up costing them less than to just let the price get to $69.420. Expect them to fight dirty until the bitter end. 
4. **T*****heir Current Strategy:*** Wallstreet calls us ""dumb money"", because they think we are unsophisticated and just chase after a quick buck, and we have short attention spans. They'll try and continue to manipulate the price so that the stock will trade sideways, or continuous short ladder attacks, trying to scare paper hands into selling, and bore diamond hands into selling as well. They will also try to tempt us with other ""NEXT GME"" type plays and may even artificially raise prices of a stock or two (IE: SILVER) to try and get people to hop off the GME rocket. They'll use media to continue to push narratives that the GME short squeeze is over, short positions are covered, and redditors have moved onto something else. If this fails, then they may simulate a ""SQUEEZE"" by suddenly letting the price go up to $700 or $800, then unleash a short ladder attack unlike which we have ever seen, to simulate the sell off, so idiot retards will be scared into thinking they missed the top, so they will all sell. But if people just look at the volume, they'll know it's all a ruse. 

&#x200B;

What we're doing, our advantage, and why the enemy can't win.

1. ***This is a movement:*** This has become more than a few people of a subreddit trying to make a quickbuck off of a short squeeze. This has become a movement that represents the struggle between the corruption of wallstreet and the 1% vs the 99%, the common people. News agencies from all over the globe are reporting on this and have their eyes on this. We have ape brothers and sisters all over the world buying and holding this stock together. We even have a few outspoken whales on our side as well, as well as politicians from both sides of the spectrum speaking out for our side as well. We have billboards being bought all over the country, airplanes flying banners about GME. A global movement will crush any hedge fund.

2. ***We are holding:*** We are getting smarter, tougher, and slowly but surely paper hands are turning into diamond hands. We managed to hold during the short attack to \~$110 on Thursday, and that was when they froze our ability to buy across many brokerages. They will never have another chance to do this again now with everyone watching. The volume trading these days is getting smaller and smaller. Any price decrease is strictly from short ladder attacks, and not us selling, due to tiny tiny volumes.

3. ***Nuclear Bomb still undetonated****:* Short Squeeze still coming, it hasn't happened yet. We know this because the volume of shares bought is not nearly enough to show the shorts have bought enough to be covered.   
[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1q9hy/l2\_nyse\_quotes\_for\_gme\_volume\_the\_squeeze\_hasnt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1q9hy/l2_nyse_quotes_for_gme_volume_the_squeeze_hasnt/)

4. ***Enemy loses money everyday, we don't:*** It costs the hedge funds billions to continue to fight this war of attrition becauase they continue to eat insanely high fees and interest on their short positions because the cost of borrowing remains high because the short interest are remaining high. Meanwhile we don't have to pay anything for holding our stocks. We can literally just hold and not have a short squeeze and just from the cost of borrowing alone the hedge funds will run out of money, so that's why there will come a time where it's cheaper for them to cover their positions rather than just keep on bleeding until they die out. I don't think they can hold out for another month of trading sideways with no progress. I believe in Feb we will see some major action. It could even start as early as tomorrow, because that's the last day shorts have to cover their 1/29 puts that expired. 
5. ***We're not breaking the laws, they are:*** Recent rumor mills are saying that there are a lot of [counterfit stocks](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) circulating and the hedge funds and clearing houses are all in on it, and once they need to start to find shares to buy to cover their short positions, things are going to explode in a way that is unprecedented.

6. ***We're getting smarter:*** Everyday we get new DD on WSB and more and more people are reading these DD's and understand how to diamond hands, and can now filter out fake news from mainstream media. We've just hit 8 mil subs; our subs are going exponential. We've recovered from the RH fiasco and we're primed and loaded on other brokerages like Fidelity. We are more ready than EVER to continue this war and this fight.

8,2021-02-02 00:22:41.532292,double_a_mtl,Some proper DD to explain why $NOK isn't a bot stock and you should actually pay attention to it. 🚀🚀🚀,"I've been reading a lot of you posting about the fact that $NOK is a bot stock and that it's being posted to distract people from $GME.

Many people don't seem to realize it, but no smart investors put all their eggs into one basket.

I've got multiple large bets going at any given time, this way, if one doesn't work out, I can always bank on another one.

&#x200B;

That said, here's why I decided to put 100k into $NOK.

*This is not financial advice, do your own DD.*

&#x200B;

Let's start with financials:

The company has been working to grow FCF (Free cash flow) for the past couple of years and have delivered 5 quarters of positive FCF so far. Expected to continue this quarter.

Their operating margins have improved from breakeven in 2018 to just over 9% in 2020.

They are siting on a total cash balance of **over 8 billion dollars.**

The market cap is 23 billion dollars. To put this in perspective. You're paying 4.90$ per share for 1.92$ in Cash + Nokia's assets.

The company's expected to reinstate their dividend.

We're paying \~1x sales to buy the company.

The board is authorized to issue or buy back up to 10% of the float. They have done neither.

&#x200B;

**The other reasons:**

The Covid pandemic has actually accellerated spending on 5G infrastructure. $NOK and Ericsson have been large beneficiaries of this due to the security risks related to Huauei.

$NOK's reefshark chips help carriers reduce their costs (power demand is 64% lower for example). This has helped them sell more of their products, but they don't expect full adoption until 2022.

$NOK's been investing their money into R&D as well as into turning things around. They aren't just sitting on the side, they are working to become a major player again.

Total addressable market for this is expected to be $700 billion by 2030. It's currently $10 billion.

This is a 70x increase in addressable market, for which there are only a few major players.

**The biggest risk:** Huauei is unbanned from use in the US.

 

**TLDR:** 

My positions: 20k shares, with an average cost of about 4.75$. I will be selling weekly covered calls at varying strikes, to take advantage of the high IV. I'm happy to be paid to wait.",lahby4,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0E3B13B8>

The media is intentionally leaving out all the positive transformation information that is going on inside Game Stop.  What am I talking about you might ask.  Let me ask everyone this:  If there was a company that was experiencing 300% yoy ecommerce growth, closing unprofitable stores, heading into a 200 billion TAM computer gaming industry and oh yeah, three new board members including Ryan Cohen.  

I know  everyone is looking for the big squeeze and you fucking retarded apes have done fantastic holding the line, however, there is a great long term story about to unfold here.  The current tradeable float is probably less than 10 million shares, more than likely closer to 5 million.  The institutions own over 100% and the current BUY AND HOLD strategy is working like a charm.  The hedge funds, market makers and brokerages have engaged in criminal activity to hold the stock down.  My point is, the company and Cohen hasn't said a word due to earnings coming up 3/25/21.  Just think what the stock might do if/when CEO Sherman steps aside and they announce Cohen as CEO.  Then Cohen announces his plan of how he's going to transform the company.  This is why I haven't sold along with the fact that I'm just a retarded ape like everyone else, but I really just like the stock.  

Moral of the story is JUST BUY AND HOLD and good things are in our future.",lahbuq,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0E3B1088>

16,2021-02-02 00:22:43.872421,Good_vibes311,Important to understand Equity reports to make investment decisions,"I know there is a lot of misinformation on the internet, and new investors wonder how to make the right decisions. Here is some vital information that every investor should make. We hear on the mainstream media about fundamentals; they are essential financial statements that everyone should be familiar with. 

&#x200B;

* Cash flow 
* Balance sheet 
* Income statement 

These are like the bible to investing. Also, we can hear that equity research reports are bais information. 

I recommend everyone to do their homework and read a lot about financial statements. So, you will not believe everything that is on the internet or any post, or influencer. 

It is essential to have an investment strategy a portfolio well-diversified. 

&#x200B;

This is important to know: 

&#x200B;

**Equity Search** 

Equity research is a discipline within the financial services industry, in which sell-side equity research analysts produce specialized research reports for buy-side investors and corporate leaders. Equity research plays an essential role in helping investors discover market opportunities and make informed investment decisions. 

&#x200B;

*  **An equity research repor**t is a document prepared by an equity research analyst that often provides insight on whether investors should buy, hold, or sell shares of a public company. An analyst lays out their recommendation, target price, investment thesis, valuation, and risks in an equity research report. There are multiple forms of equity research, including (but not limited to): 
*  **COMPANY REPORTS** An update report that highlights the latest news, company announcements, earnings reports, Buy Sell Hold ratings, M&A activity, anything that impacts the value of the company 
*  **INITIATION REPORT**S A comprehensive company report compiled when an analyst or firm initiates their stock coverage. Initiation reports cover all of the company's divisions and products in-depth to provide a baseline of what the company is and how it is performing. Initiation reports can be tens to hundreds of pages long, depending on the complexity of a company. 

 **What is Included in a Typical Equity Research Report?**

Research reports don’t need to follow a specific formula. Analysts at different investment banks have some latitude in determining the look and feel of their reports. But more often than not, research reports follow a certain protocol of what investors expect them to look like. A typical equity research report includes in-depth industry research, management analysis, financial histories, trends, forecasting, valuations, and investors' recommendations. Sometimes called broker research reports or investment research reports, equity research reports are designed to provide a comprehensive snapshot that investors or corporate leaders can leverage to make informed decisions. 

In conclusion: You guys have to read a lot and do your own research. Make sure it is a reliable source and learn to read between the lines.

Best of luck to everyone",lahagd,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0E3BC670>

19,2021-02-02 00:22:44.622282,tomsal814,What is going on with GME,"The Creation of Counterfeit Shares — There are a variety of names that the securities industry has dreamed up that are euphemisms for counterfeit shares. Don't be fooled : Unless the short seller has actually borrowed a real share from the account of a long investor, the short sale is counterfeit. It doesn't matter what you call it and it may become non–counterfeit if a share is later borrowed, but until then, there are more shares in the system than the company has sold.
The magnitude of the counterfeiting is hundreds of millions of shares every day, and it may be in the billions. The real answer is locked within the prime brokers and the DTC. Incidentally, counterfeiting of securities is as illegal as counterfeiting currency, but because it is all done electronically, has other identifiers and industry rules and practices, i.e. naked shorts, fails–to–deliver, SHO exempt, etc. the industry and the regulators pretend it isn't counterfeiting. Also, because of the regulations that govern the securities, certain counterfeiting falls within the letter of the rules. The rules, by design, are fraught with loopholes and decidedly short on allowing companies and investors access to information about manipulations of their stock.
The creation of counterfeit shares falls into three general categories. Each category has a plethora of devices that are used to create counterfeit shares.
Fails–to–Deliver — If a short seller cannot borrow a share and deliver that share to the person who purchased the (short) share within the three days allowed for settlement of the trade, it becomes a fail–to–deliver and hence a counterfeit share; however the share is transacted by the exchanges and the DTC as if it were real. Regulation SHO, implemented in January 2005 by the SEC, was supposed to end wholesale fails–to–deliver, but all it really did was cause the industry to exploit other loopholes, of which there are plenty (see 2 and 3 below).
Since forced buy–ins rarely occur, the other consequences of having a fail–to–deliver are inconsequential, so it is frequently ignored. Enough fails–to–deliver in a given stock will get that stock on the SHO list, (the SEC's list of stocks that have excessive fails–to–deliver) – which should (but rarely does) see increased enforcement. Penalties amount to a slap on the wrist, so large fails–to–deliver positions for victim companies have remained for months and years.
A major loophole that was intentionally left in Reg SHO was the grandfathering in of all pre–SHO naked shorting. This rule is akin to telling bank robbers, “If you make it to the front door of the bank before the cops arrive, the theft is okay.”
Only the DTC knows for certain how many short shares are perpetual fails–to–deliver, but it is most likely in the billions. In 1998, REFCO, a large short hedge fund, filed bankruptcy and was unable to meet margin calls on their naked short shares. Under this scenario, the broker dealers are the next line of financial responsibility. The number of shares that allegedly should have been bought in was 400,000,000, but that probably never happened. The DTC — owned by the broker dealers — just buried 400,000,000 counterfeit shares in their system, where they allegedly remain — grandfathered into “legitimacy” by the SEC. Because they are grandfathered into “legitimacy”, the SEC, DTC and prime brokers pretend they are no longer fails–to–deliver, even though the victim companies have permanently suffered a 400 million share dilution in their stock.
Three months prior to SHO, the aggregate fails–to–deliver on the NASDAQ and the NYSE averaged about 150 million shares a day. Three months after SHO it dropped by about 20 million, as counterfeit shares found new hiding places (see 2 and 3 below). It is noteworthy that aggregate fails–to–deliver are the only indices of counterfeit shares that the DTC and the prime brokers report to the SEC. The bulk of the counterfeiting remains undisclosed, so don't be deceived when the SEC and the industry minimize the fails–to–deliver information. It is akin to the lookout on the Titanic reporting an ice cube ahead.
Ex–clearing counterfeiting — The second tier of counterfeiting occurs at the broker dealer level. This is called ex–clearing. Multiple tricks are utilized for the purpose of disguising naked shorts that are fails–to–deliver as disclosed shorts, which means that a share has been borrowed. They also make naked shorts “invisible” to the system so they don't become fails–to–deliver, which is the only thing the SEC tracks.
Some of the tricks are as follows:
Stock sales are either a long sale or a short sale. When a stock is transacted the broker checks the appropriate box. By mismarking the trading ticket –checking the long box when it is actually a short sale the short never shows up, unless they get caught, which doesn't happen often. The position usually gets reconciled when the short covers.
Settlement of stock transactions is supposed to occur within three days, at which time a naked short should become a fail–to–deliver, however the SEC routinely and automatically grants a number of extensions before the naked short gets reported as a fail–to–deliver. Most of the short hedge funds and broker dealers have multiple entities, many offshore, so they sell large naked short positions from entity to entity. Position rolls, as they are called, are frequently done broker to broker, or hedge fund to hedge fund, in block trades that never appear on an exchange. Each movement resets the time clock for the naked position becoming a fail–to–deliver and is a means of quickly getting a company off of the SHO threshold list.
The prime brokers may do a buy–in of a naked short position. If they tell the short hedge fund that we are going to buy–in at 3:59 EST on Friday, the hedge fund naked shorts into their own buy–in (or has a co–conspirator do it) and rolls their position, hence circumventing Reg SHO.
Most of the large broker dealers operate internationally, so when regulators come in (they almost always “call ahead”) or compliance people come in (ditto), large naked positions are moved out of the country and returned at a later date.
The stock lend is enormously profitable for the broker dealers who charge the short sellers large fees for the “borrowed” shares, whether they are real or counterfeit. When shares are loaned to a short, they are supposed to remain with the short until he covers his position by purchasing real shares. The broker dealers do one–day lends, which enables the short to identify to the SEC the account that shares were borrowed from. As soon as the report is sent in, the shares are returned to the broker dealer to be loaned to the next short. This allows eight to ten shorts to borrow the same shares, resetting the SHO–fail–to–deliver clock each time, which makes all of the counterfeit shares look like legitimate shares. The broker dealers charge each short for the stock lend.
Margin account buyers, because of loopholes in the rules, inadvertently aid the shorts. If short A sells a naked short he has three days to deliver a borrowed share. If the counterfeit share is purchased in a margin account, it is immediately put into the stock lend and, for a fee, is available as a borrowed share to the short who counterfeited it in the first place. This process is perpetually fluid with multiple parties, but it serves to create more counterfeit shares and is an example of how a counterfeit share gets “laundered” into a legitimate borrowed share.
Margin account agreements give the broker dealers the right to lend those shares without notifying the account owner. Shares held in cash accounts, IRA accounts and any restricted shares are not supposed to be loaned without express consent from the account owner. Broker dealers have been known to change cash accounts to margin accounts without telling the owner, take shares from IRA accounts, take shares from cash accounts and lend restricted shares. One of the prime brokers recently took a million shares from cash accounts of the company's founding investors without telling the owners or the stockbroker who represented ownership. The shares were put into the stock lend, which got the company off the SHO threshold list, and opened the door for more manipulative shorting.
This is a sample of tactics used. For a company that is under attack, the counterfeit shares that exist at this ex–clearing tier can be ten or twenty times the number of fails–to–deliver, which is the only category tracked and policed by the SEC.
Continuous Net Settlement — The third tier of counterfeiting occurs at the DTC level. The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) is a holding company owned by the major broker dealers, and has four subsidiaries. The subsidiaries that are of interest are the Depository Trust Company (DTC) and the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC). The DTC has an account for each broker dealer, which is further broken down to each customer of that broker dealer. These accounts are electronic entries. Ninety seven percent of the actual stock certificates are in the vault at the DTC with the DTC nominee's name on them. The NSCC processes transactions, provides the broker dealers with a central clearing source, and operates the stock borrow program.
When a broker dealer processes the sale of a short share, the broker dealer has three days to deliver a borrowed share to the purchaser and the purchaser has three days to deliver the money. In the old days, if the buyer did not receive his shares by settlement day, three days after the trade, he took his money back and undid the transaction. When the stock borrow program and electronic transfers were put in place in 1981, this all changed. At that point the NSCC guaranteed the performance of the buyers and sellers and would settle the transaction even though the seller was now a fail–to–deliver on the shares he sold. The buyer has a counterfeit share in his account, but the NSCC transacts it as if it were real.
At the end of each day, if a broker dealer has sold more shares of a given stock than he has in his account with the DTC, he borrows shares from the NSCC, who borrows them from the broker dealers who have a surplus of shares. So far it sounds like the whole system is in balance, and for any given stock the net number of shares in the DTC is equal to the number of shares issued by the company.
The short seller who has sold naked – he had no borrowed shares – can cure his fail–to–deliver position and avoid the required forced buy–in by borrowing the share through the NSCC stock borrow program.
Here is the hocus pocus that creates millions of counterfeit shares.
When a broker dealer has a net surplus of shares of any given company in his account with the DTC, only the net amount is deducted from his surplus position and put in the stock borrow program. However the broker dealer does not take a like number of shares from his customer's individual accounts. The net surplus position is loaned to a second broker dealer to cover his net deficit position.
Let's say a customer at the second broker dealer purchased shares from a naked short seller — counterfeit shares. His broker dealer “delivers” those shares to his account from the shares borrowed from the DTC. The lending broker dealer did not take the shares from any specific customers' account, but the borrowing broker dealer put the borrowed shares in specific customer's accounts. Now the customer at the second prime broker has “real” shares in his account. The problem is it's the same “real” shares that are in the customer's account at the first prime broker.
The customer account at the second prime broker now has a “real” share, which the prime broker can lend to a short who makes a short sale and delivers that share to a third party. Now there are three investors with the same counterfeit shares in their accounts.
Because the DTC stock borrow program, and the debits and credits that go back and forth between the broker dealers, only deals with the net difference, it never gets reconciled to the actual number of shares issued by the company. As long as the broker dealers don't repay the total stock borrowed and only settle their net differences, they can “grow” a company's issued stock.
This process is called Continuous Net Settlement (CNS) and it hides billions of counterfeit shares that never make it to the Reg. SHO radar screen, as the shares “borrowed” from the DTC are treated as a legitimate borrowed shares.
For companies that are under attack, the counterfeit shares that are created by the CNS program are thought to be ten or twenty times the disclosed fails–to–deliver, and the true CNS totals are only obtained by successfully serving the DTC with a subpoena. The SEC doesn't even get this information. The actual process is more complex and arcane than this, but the end result is accurately depicted.
Ex–clearing and CNS counterfeiting are used to create an enormous reserve of counterfeit shares. The industry refers to these as “strategic fails–to–deliver.” Most people would refer to these as a stockpile of counterfeit shares that can be used for market manipulation. One emerging company for which we have been able to get or make reasonable estimates of the total short interest, the disclosed short interest, the available stock lend and the fails–to–deliver, has fifty “buried” counterfeit shares for every fail–to–deliver share, which is the only thing that the SEC tracks, consequently the SEC has not acted on shareholder complaints that the stock is being manipulated.

The Anatomy of a Short Attack — Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.
The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.
When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.
Typical tactics include the following:
Flooding the offer side of the board — Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.
The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.
By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of “strategic fails-to-deliver” and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will “mask” the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.
Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other “success” parameters, the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.

Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands — all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.
Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called “crashing” the stock and a successful “crash” is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash “stick” or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:
Media assault — The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately purchase real shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These real shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.
The shorts have “friendly” reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the Wall Street Journal, Barrons, the New York Times, Gannett Publications (USA Today and the Arizona Republic), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the “friendly” reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.
One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in USA Today during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair — proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times. This “mistake” was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven USA Today editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation “Due to a mathematical error” appeared three days later — after the damage was done to the stock price.
Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:
When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fictionâ€¦ you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down — it's a pretty good game.
This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air, however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube.
Analyst Reports — Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports. The reports, which were represented as being independent, were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack. There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this. These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned “friendly” media. All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation.
Planting moles in target companies — The shorts plant “moles” inside target companies. The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors. They steal confidential information, which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media. The information may not be true, may be out of context, or the stolen documents may be altered. Things that are supposed to be confidential, like SEC preliminary inquiries, end up as front-page news with the short-friendly media.
Frivolous SEC investigations — The shorts “leak” tips to the SEC about “corporate malfeasance” by the target company. The SEC, which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests, swoops in as the supposed “confidential inquiry” is leaked to the short media.
The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings. Occasionally they do uncover an Enron, but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty-five percent. The announcement of no or little findings comes months later, but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible. The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community.
Class Action lawsuits — Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes, a handful of law firms immediately file class-action shareholder suits. Milberg Weiss, before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation, could be counted on to file a class-action suit against a company that was under short attack. Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media, again causing panic among small investors.
Interfering with target company's customers, financings, etc. — If the shorts became aware of clients, customers or financings that the target company was working on, they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction. Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product.
Pulling margin from long customers — The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover.
Paid bashers — The shorts will hire paid bashers who “invade” the message boards of the company. The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation.

This is not every dirty trick that the shorts use when they are crashing the stock. Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics.

TL;DR
These funds will short sell the same shares over and over increasing the amount of “conterfeit shares” and they will use all their power to use media to divert attention from illegal activities",laha43,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0E3BD7A8>

54,2021-02-02 00:22:55.019653,LiveLaughLibor,‘Meme Stock’ Volatility and the Real Winners,"  

First of all, this is somewhat of a long post and I hope you all enjoy it. I hope this can start some discussion.

**Tldr:** The 'Reddit Raid' has impacted the overall economy in positive ways that we could not have predicted. We have been the lifeline that these companies needed. $AMC and $GME have benefited greatly from the rise of their common equity. **Winners: Institutional Investors, Companies, Employees, Real Estate (and local communities).**

Over the past 2 weeks we have seen retail investors from around the world making significant gains on various ‘Meme stocks’. Stocks like $GME, $AMC have seen massive price appreciation as the under-served and under-represented members of society have found a new interest in investing. News outlets continue to post sensational articles on individual people becoming rich overnight because of early investments in these companies. However, the real winners out of all of this are the companies themselves, various institutional investors, employees of these companies, and real estate companies (and local communities).

**Winners**

**Institutional Investors:**

Silver Lake Partners – Silver Lake Partners is a private equity group that up until recently, had been a credit investor with $AMC. Originally owning $600 Million worth of convertible bonds back in 2018, Silver Lake disclosed on Friday January 29th that they had converted their $600 Million worth of bonds into $AMC shares and subsequently sold those shares for a $113 Million profit. This convertible bond event also dramatically benefited $AMC through the obvious reduction in debt during a tenuous operating environment (more on that later).

$GME Shareholders – It may be a surprise to many media outlets but institutional investors have made a sizeable gain when it comes to $GME shares. Fidelity, Black Rock, and Vanguard own 13.7%, 12.3%, and 7.6% of shares outstanding respectively. This has led to a gain of $2.9 Billion, $2.6 Billion, and $1.6 Billion respectively for each of these institutional investors. 

Ontario Teachers Pension Fund – The recent retail action in favour of mall REIT Macerich ($MAC) led to the largest shareholder; the Ontario Teachers Pension Fund, cashing out for $500 Million which has helped boost capital available for the pension obligations of the teachers paying into this pension fund.

**Companies:**

$AMC - Due to the convertible bond action I highlighted earlier with regards to Silver Lake Partners, AMC saw an immediate reduction in the company’s debt by $600 Million dollars as the credit investor opted to take common equity instead. This reduced AMC’s debt burden and in turn has allowed them to look more favorable in the eyes of the credit market. The reduction in debt also helps AMC navigate the challenging operating environment that has been brought about by the pandemic and the restrictions. Two weeks ago, AMC was also able to raise $917 Million by tapping debt and equity markets which helped stave off concerns of bankruptcy. 

I suspect that $GME will conduct an equity offering in hopes of raising cash to pay down debt. 

These developments have been extremely beneficial to both $AMC and $GME and may have prevented bankruptcy of both businesses. At the end of the day I don’t want to see either business go under because of the compounding effects it has on the livelihoods of employees, the real estate market, and general blight on communities if in fact their brick and mortar spaces became vacant. 

**Employees:** 

$GME has 14,000 full time and 42,000 part time employees (as of 2019).

$AMC has 4,408 full time and 36,000 part time employees (as of 2018).

The survival of these companies mean that these people still have a livelihood and this avoids adding more to the already substantially high unemployment numbers nationally. 

**Real Estate:**

$GME has 5,509 brick and mortar locations.

$AMC has 1,004 brick and mortar locations.

The survival of these companies mean that real estate companies avoid large vacancies and communities avoid blighted zones of lost business.

The events of the past few weeks have been the lifeline that was needed and I hope these businesses can be turned around. Godspeed.",lah33s,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0E228B50>
55,2021-02-02 00:22:55.279131,MicroSofty88,Why I’m long on MGM,"**Multiple tail winds**

1. Regulation - similar to cannabis, American society is becoming more accepting of sports betting. More than 18 states have legalized sports betting in some form. I believe this is going to continue to trend toward full legalization across the US. State governments need to balance their budgets and will look to industries like sports betting for additional revenue. 

State by state legal info [here](https://www.actionnetwork.com/news/legal-sports-betting-united-states-projections).

MGM has one of the leading sports betting apps and existing partnerships with major sports leagues and media companies, which will allow it to easily operate in new states as gambling comes online. 

2. COVID vaccines - like many of you, I’m very bullish and think the travel industries will recover faster than predicted due to pent up demand. People will be looking for entertainment and travel options as soon as vaccine distribution hits a tipping point. MGM owns the most casinos Las Vegas, nearly 25% of the properties on the Las Vegas Strip, and controls an even larger portion of Las Vegas gambling revenues.


**Mergers and acquisitions**

1. MGM Studios is the media subsidiary of MGM. They own the rights to franchises like James Bond and Rocky. With the streaming wars in full swing MGM is shopping MGM Studios to the major streaming services. Estimated market value is about $5.5B.

2. MGM has been in discussions to acquire Ladbrokes/Entain for $11B to counter Caesars’ acquisition of William Hill. Although discussions have broken down, I think they will still try to make some kind of acquisition to counter recent activity by Caesars and Penn while it’s cheap to borrow money. 

**TLDR**

There are many ways MGM could pop. This allows you to bet on the recovery of the travel industry in Vegas with a probability that m&a announcements and betting legalization will cover your ass in case things don’t go as planned.

60,2021-02-02 00:22:56.794399,Galdimaster,Due Diligence - My Resons for Going Long in Blackberry,"I know that last week was a bit on the turbulent side for BB. I decided to double-check my original BB DD, as a way to remind myself of why I invested in the first place. From my point of view, nothing has changed in the fundamentals, and I am still very well satisfied with my investment.

Currently, I have 410 stocks, with an average buy-in of $17,62 per stock.

Before getting down to the good stuff, I just want to point out that **this is in no way financal advice**, neither do I take any responsibility for your financial choices based on my text. I'm just your average happy amateur.

**THE PHONE COMPANY THAT SWITCHED TO IoT AND CYBER SECURITY**

For starters, you can't really exclusively call Blackberry a phone company anymore. They've switched their main focus to Cyber Security and IoT. Today, BB provides solutions for Unified Endpoint Security, Penetration Testing, Ransomware Protection and Blackberry QNX (remember that last one, because it's important).

In December of 2020, a massive attack occured against SolarWinds, a major IT firm that provides software for entities ranging from Fortune 500 companies to the US government. The US agencies in question that got attacked were: parts of the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, the Department of Energy, the National Nuclear Security Administration, and the Treasury.

However, **not a single of BlackBerry's customers were affected by the hack**.

**BLACKBERRY QNX**

Blackberry owns and develops the closed source QNX operating system, which is a real-time operating system (meaning that it can process data without buffer delays). If you have a smartphone or a car, chances are that in one way or another, it runs with QNX embedded.

Read more about QNX [here](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2019/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-150-million-vehicles).

**PARTNERSHIP WITH BAIDU, XPENG and GAC GROUP: EV-INDUSTRY IN CHINA**

Just like in other developed parts of the world, it's springtime for the electrical vehicle-market in China. You might have heard about some of their most successful brands: NIO, BAIDU, XPENG and GAC group.

NIO has a market cap of **$61.6 bn**, XPENG has a market cap of **$31.5 bn**, Baidu has a market cap of **$80,16**, and GAC group has a market cap of a whooping **$114,7 bn**.

Why is this good for Blackberry?

1. In August 2020, BB announced that they will be *""powering the Level 3 driving domain controller of Xpeng""* using... you guessed it! **QNX!**
2. A couple of weeks ago, BB announced that they would deepen their partnership with Chinese GAC Group, who amongst other things make electric cars. I read an article from a couple of days ago claiming that *""Future GAC electric cars will get BlackBerry driving assistance technology""* using... you guessed it! **QNX!**
3. Since April 2019, GAC group and NIO (the other EV maker) has had a joint venture in the form of the brand ""Hycan"", an electric car manufacturer. It's not farfetched to believe that there is a good chance of the Hycans to have QNX embedded as well.

Read more [here](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology-301211498.html).

**PARTNERSHIP WITH AMAZON**

As you all probably already know, Amazon is the world's largest e-commerce and cloud platform company. BlackBerry recently partnered with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to launch a new connected vehicle platform that merges BlackBerry's QNX operating system with AWS's IoT services.

AWS launched its IoT platform in 2015. At the time, Amazon stated that it would make it easier for developers to create apps that link to myriad IoT gadgets, including smart speakers, home appliances, wearables, and connected cars. AWS is already the world's top cloud platform, so it makes perfect sense to integrate its IoT service into the most widely used embedded operating system for connected cars.

By linking QNX to the cloud, automakers can instantly monitor a vehicle's EV battery levels and vehicle subsystems, provide over-the-air software updates, and personalize vehicle cockpits,  advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), and machine learning models for autonomous driving through cloud-based apps.

This reinforces BlackBerry's market-dominating position in embedded operating systems for connected cars, which also circles back to BB's endevours on the Chinese EV-market.

**PROJECT KUIPER**

I want to warn you all that this next part is purely speculation on my part.

From Wikipedia:  **Kuiper Systems LLC** is a subsidiary of Amazon that was set up in 2019 to deploy a large broadband satellite internet constellation to provide broadband internet connectivity. The deployment is also referred to by its project name ""**Project Kuiper**"". Amazon announced that it would be investing $10 billion in this project to deploy the satellite internet constellation.

How could BB fit into this thing?

Well, here's my hypothesis:

Why would Amazon start a long-term partnership with BlackBerry? Well, because BlackBerry has competency that Amazon lacks in-house of course. If Amazon wants to send satellites to space, why wouldn't they use Blackberry, when QNX has already been used in rockets by NASA and SpaceX?

Although there isn't any concrete evidence for my claims about BB and Project Kuiper, I personally don't believe that my thougts are way ""out there"". I guess time will tell if I'm right, but it's what I'm betting on!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

TL;DR:

* BB's QNX operating system could become huge during 2021 due to BB's involvement with Amazon and Chinese EV-manufacturers.
* BB could play an important part in Project Kuiper",lah1uf,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0E23CEB0>

You philosophy guys may have heard of Occam’s Razor: The simplest explanation is usually correct. 

GameStop had one of the craziest rallies of all time, $2.57 last summer to $500. The popular opinion is “hedge funds manipulating the price down” right? Well GameStop is down 65% from the peak last week, and a lot of you will baghold to the ground. Here’s the simplest explanation: Initial short squeeze blew up several funds (RIP Melvin), guys who got in early used the hype as an exit opportunity, new shorts entered near the peak, and the 5 million new kids here listened to Dave Portnoy and bought the top bc diamond handz. 

It’s not manipulation when a stock that ran up 2000% in a week pulls back, it’s mean reversion. The manipulation was what we did pushing it all the way to $500 and wrecking shop on the way. 

“But the VW chart from 09!” This isn’t VW. Porsche cornered VW shares by itself and refused to sell. They controlled that squeeze single handedly. There have been 100M shares trading daily, you really think everyone here is actually holding? If they were the price never would have dropped back below $400. Smart money took profits and everyone else is holding out of hope. Hopium is a dangerous drug.

How did you think this would end? Obviously profit taking would come eventually, and it looks like it hit at $500. Posting a screenshot of your 5 shares and a 💎✋🏼 meme won’t hold the price up forever. The real winners got in early and took profits as the media caught on.

This is the stock market. You come here to make money. You buy low and sell high. If you refused to sell bc you believed the hype, that’s on you and you alone. You can sell at anytime, so don’t blame others for your losses.

RIP the guy who YOLO’d at $300 today, may as well have set that money on fire. I don’t like seeing losses, I want everyone to win. But when you refuse to take profits or acknowledge a potential top, it’s on you 100% to eat the losses.

The same guys crying market manipulation now were buying SPY puts out of spite in March. Could GME have gone up more? Sure. Would SPY have crashed more without JPow in March? Probably? But guess what? What ifs don’t matter in the stock market. You trade what happens.

What’s Happened the Past Few Days?: The Anatomy of a Short Ladder Attack

Published courtesy of Citizens for Securities Reform, at http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html

Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.

The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.

When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.


Typical tactics include the following:

Flooding the offer side of the board - Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.

The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.

By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of ""strategic fails-to-deliver"" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will ""mask"" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.

Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other ""success"" parameters; the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.

Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands - all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.


Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called ""crashing"" the stock and a successful ""crash"" is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash ""stick"" or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:

Media Assault -

The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately put the victim into bankruptcy or obtain shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.

The shorts have ""friendly"" reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the Wall Street Journal, Barrons, the New York Times, Gannett Publications (USA Today and the Arizona Republic), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the ""friendly"" reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that short hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.

One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in USA Today during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair - proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times. This ""mistake"" was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven USA Today editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation ""Due to a mathematical error"" appeared three days later - after the damage was done to the stock price.

Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.

This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube.


Analyst Reports -

Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports. The reports, which were represented as being independent, were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack. There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this. These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned ""friendly"" media. All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation.

Planting moles in target companies -

The shorts plant ""moles"" inside target companies. The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors. They steal confidential information, which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media. The information may not be true, may be out of context, or the stolen documents may be altered. Things that are supposed to be confidential, like SEC preliminary inquiries, end up as front-page news with the short-friendly media.

Frivolous SEC investigations -

The shorts ""leak"" tips to the SEC about ""corporate malfeasance"" by the target company. The SEC, which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests, swoops in as the supposed ""confidential inquiry"" is leaked to the short media.

The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings. Occasionally they do uncover an Enron, but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty-five percent. The announcement of no or little findings comes months later, but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible. The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community.

Class Action lawsuits -

Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes, a handful of law firms immediately file class-action shareholder suits. Milberg Weiss, before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation, could be counted on to file a class-action suit against a company that was under short attack. Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media, again causing panic among small investors.

Interfering with target company's customers, financings, etc. -

If the shorts became aware of clients, customers or financings that the target company was working on, they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction. Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product.


Pulling margin from long customers -

The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover. (Click here for more on Pulling Margin).

Paid bashers -

The shorts will hire paid bashers who ""invade"" the message boards of the company. The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation. (Click here for Confessions Of A Paid Stock Basher).

This is not every trick the shorts use when they are crashing the stock. Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics.

How Pervasive Is This?

At any given point in time more than 100 emerging companies are under attack as described above. This is not to be confused with the day-to-day shorting that occurs in virtually every stock, which is purportedly about thirty percent of the daily volume.

The success rate for short attacks is over ninety percent-a success being defined as putting the company into bankruptcy or driving the stock price to pennies. It is estimated that 1000 small companies have been put out of business by the shorts. Admittedly, not every small company deserves to succeed, but they do deserve a level playing field.

The secrecy that surrounds the shorts, the prime brokers, the DTC and the regulatory agencies makes it impossible to accurately estimate how much money has been stolen from the investing public by these predators, but the total is measured in billions of dollars. The problem is also international in scope",lagzcz,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0E275DC0>

81,2021-02-02 00:23:03.391088,ItsAllJustASickGame,"I know everyone is feeling down about the red, but please listen to this example. This is the Prisoner's Dilemma.","Remember in The Dark Knight when the joker rigs up the two ferries with explosives and gives the ferries the detonator to blow up the other boat? Each of you has been given the detonator to other people's money. If you press it, you'll take your reduced gains/losses, but you'll be taking that from another retard, not the hedge funds.

That's where I'm noticing people are at right now. I've been tracking emotional sentiment across many spam channels and communities, and from what I've seen, traction is slowing down and the big question ""Do we sell and take our loss?"" is coming up. I guarantee there are a lot of people who would stand in solidarity and/or lie just to keep the mob going. That's how Prisoner's Dilemma works. MANY of you are still diamond hands and I commend your valor, but we need to rally the soldiers who don't have that kind of gumption. We need to stand united. Praise u/deepfuckingvalue for staying in the trade fully.

# Most Important Part is this paragraph:

Let me explain the Prisoner's Dilemma: 3 people are arrested. Those 3 people are then questioned individually, but the cops have nothing on them so if they can't get a confession, they all walk free. To try and intimidate them, they tell them if they rat out their friends, they can walk free, but if their friend rats them out first, they won't get that deal. ""Do you really trust your friend not to rat you out?"" All it takes is solidarity and all 3 walk away and win. But, if one person breaks and rats them out for selfish gains, then the whole thing breaks down.

You and I, and everyone, all knew coming into this it was a boom or bust trade. The noobies expected immediate returns and are the ones risking the integrity of this play. But we can still prevail. We just have to not rat out our fellow autists to the hedge funds.

If you overextended yourself and are about to lose your rent money, we understand. We'll buy your shares back. But, remember, we always knew this could zero out and it's important to show your solidarity, because without it, this is over.

We know the hedge funds are cheating, manipulating media, acting corruptly, and showing their true colors. That means we are winning. They wouldn't need these tactics otherwise. They had the whole weekend to come up with a new strategy to dwindle our resolve and to be honest, I can see that it's having an effect on some of you. We just got mortared something fierce and we're stuck in the trenches with our ears ringing. That doesn't mean the battle is lost.

Rest assured that the majority of us are NOT selling and if you are in, all you have to do is **hold.**

This is a test of human nature. Will you be selfless or selfish? Will you trust in your fellow retard or turncoat and run away? Now you show your true nature.

GIVE THEM NOTHING, BUT TAKE FROM THEM, EVERYTHING.

Forgot to say this is not financial advice. I just like the stock :).",lagybk,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0E291AD8>

TLDR for you retards who don’t have the patience and/or the ability to read is located at the bottom.

**Summary** 🚀🚀

XL fleet is a company primarily involved with the electrification of commercial fleet vehicles across the US.  This company aims to reduce carbon emissions by vehicles by fitting vehicles with electric components to transform gas powered vehicles into hybrids.

**The players**🚀🚀

Tod Hynes- The founder and president of XL Fleet who currently is a senior professor at MIT, where he lectures a graduate course, Energy Ventures. He also co-founded the MIT Clean Energy Prize.

Dimitri Kazarinoff- Current CEO of XL fleet. He is an accomplished transportation industry executive who has led impressive growth, expansion and innovation throughout his career. Prior to joining XL as CEO, Dimitri successfully scaled the hybrid power systems division of Eaton Corporation by 15x within two years.  He also has worked at General Motors.

Needless to say, the current leadership of XL fleet has decades of experience not only in Clean Energy, but also in leadership and expansion.

**Application**🚀🚀

The Implementation of electric components to vehicles is no doubt extremely beneficial to both the customer and the environment. Here’s how:

- XL’s hybrid electric  drive system improves vehicle MPG by up to 25% and reduces CO2 emissions by up to 20% for Class 2-6 fleets.

- Their Plug-In drive system improved vehicle MPG by up to 50% and reduces CO2 emissions by 33% in Ford F-150 and F-250 pickup trucks.

- XL grid is XL’s charging and power stations, and simultaneously function as driving data site analysis and solar power sites. 

These figures are pretty impressive, and saving the consumer money via gasoline consumption and saving the environment via reduced CO2 emissions is a win-win.

** Other Info**🚀🚀

- On Jan 21, 2021 XL fleet was named one of the Top 100 Impact Companies by Real Leaders Magazine

- Partners with GM and Ford, along with other well-established and successful companies such as Coca-Cola. 

- The US government will replace its entire fleet of 645,000 cars and trucks with US-made electric vehicles, president Joe Biden said on Jan. 25, while signing a “Buy America” executive order that creates new guidelines for the government’s $600 billion in annual spending on goods and services.  XL fleet can capitalize on this opportunity to further expand their operations and boost their publicity

🚀🚀- This stock is currently over 70% shorted with a low float (~8,000,000). Now this is not the next GME by any means, but I believe that the foundation that this company has and the fact that the Biden Administration is focusing so heavily on EV will drive this stock upward quickly. 🚀🚀

**TLDR**

XL fleet is poised to rocket to the stratosphere based on its foundation, application under the Biden administration, and its partnerships (All mentioned above).  Couple this with its low float and high short percentage (70%+) and we’ve got ourselves an early boarding pass to Alpha  Centauri. 

Alright retards, resume brandishing those pitchforks and rage on against Robinhood, Citadel, Melvin, and 🏳️‍🌈🐻, but do so with XL fleet in mind.  

Giraffe out.

Positions- 200 shares and several 8/20 25c

91,2021-02-02 00:23:06.620974,Sierra-FRCKTP,Caledonia hedge fund Shorting AUS REITs,"""It was ironic that on the eve of the US shorting battle, $10bn Australian hedge fund Caledonia wrote to its clients to tell them it was planning to short Australia's large office and retail-based property trusts, plus others involved in the retail sector."" - Robert Gottliebsen, The Weekend Australian, 30 January 2021, page 31.

Rents have recovered 80-90% for the largest shopping center REIT (SCG:ASX), but the prices have languished. The two largest REITs are undervalued based on most of the freedoms enjoyed by consumers, the very strict border controls to maintain those freedoms and the very busy 'new norm' I'm already seeing in shopping centers managed by both SCG and VCX.

Hopefully more investors will appreciate that the premium shops that these REITs own and manage are really irreplaceable, and will continue to thrive. Already, better shops (in product and service) and more well-funded shops have replaced those that close down earlier due to Covid, it's a GOOD LOOK and IMPROVEMENT, and rents will continue to roll in.

This shorting is foolhardy unless covered well before mass vaccination by OCT / positive news of rent numbers in Feb/Mar.",lagx48,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0E2B18C8>

96,2021-02-02 00:23:08.247109,baldwin987,Think logically about silver (not a bot 420 69 heehee),"Okay guys, there's been a lot of talk here about silver being fake news to pull the momentum away from $GME. I am in no way trying to say that you guys are wrong, or that $GME is the way, I'm just an idiot with a perspective. 

But hear me out. 

If the media posts about WSB being in silver trying to pull a gamestop, but WSB says that they're not in silver and that it's fake news, why did the price go up today? The answer seems pretty straightforward. You guys rocked the world with $GME and the rest of the world is hungry for some action. If WSB didn't push silver up today, it must have been all of the average people watching the news that missed $GME and want to catch the next wave. Why would this buying stop? 

I can't imagine a single scenario where silver doesn't go up. It's just a matter of time. 
$GME is headed to the moon, no doubt. But so is silver. And it's happening regardless of how you feel about it.",lagvo4,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0E2B53A0>

98,2021-02-02 00:23:08.830866,BigBump,The secret about GME the big boys don't want you to know.....,"My fellow Apes:

What happens when your order goes through and you get your shares? The broker/market maker needs to offset that position to ensure liquidity in the market. So what do they do? They buy the opposite direction - a ""hedge""

What does this mean with GME right now? Well, all the share are gone, this is quite well known. So, while we are buying calls and shares into the dips, it's enabling the sale of shorts and buying of puts to hedge the positions. But what if......

You begin to buy LONG DATED AT OR IN THE MONEY put options? Well, the market makers have to hedge against that too....by buying shares. They have to have the shares for you to sell to the other side of those contracts. Shares that don't exist anywhere because they're all being held by us. Why long-dated? Because if they think the option contracts won't be in the money in time they just ignore them, but long dated contracts carry more time risk so they hedge them.

Right now we are fighting a battle by using strength against strength, but if we use their own strength against them....They are fucked.

TDLR: Hold your GME shares and long dated calls. Buy long dated puts and force the market makers to squeeze themselves.",lagvjd,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0E2B5E98>
