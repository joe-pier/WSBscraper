While it is true that GME is probably still shorted significantly we don't know how much - there is a theory involving barbells of call and put options, etc - but those are unverified and cannot be verified since we see no data.

Laddering is a legit strategy - but we cannot verify who is doing it or whether it is legitimate order flow.

Mad about what happened today and trying to recoup losses into and then some throughout the rest of the year? I might have a play for you that could 4x your current investment. I consider myself in a lot of ways to be an investor that spends a lot of time research high-growth stocks that have a clear market fit/product that will grow into the future. I was actually an early investor in NIO at $12 a share and sold around the $55 dollar mark with 4x profits. I like NIO, but I feel that the general EV market is in a bubble considering we are still years and years away from EV adoption in all cars. If you asked the EV manufacturers to supply the entire American public with EV cars and infrastructure - it would be impossible as they cannot scale and produce that rapidly. With NIO in particular - I mainly sold because I see the renewable energy stocks to have a more promising future in 2021 than EV cars since it's going to take them time to scale, and I don't expect them to repeat the same success in 2021.

Where did I put that profit? I put it right into GEVO as I believe BioFuels are the most sensible short-medium term solution for the world we live in. I am not crazy how GEVOs revenue numbers have been in the last few years, but I'm going to let that slide because of environmental/political factors that will sure to make it a major player in the future. On top of that, Biden elected the former co-founder of GEVO into his science cabinet which only increases my confidence. Right now, GEVO has $500M+ in cash on hand, zero debt, and over a billion dollars worth in potential contract value.

If you've been following the news - you would see how the big oil companies are growing concerned regarding regulations on the new administration - as even they see the writing on the wall. What I predict is, GEVO has the renewable patent technology they could license to these oil companies. Big Oil will partner with proven technologies before trying to re-invent the wheel (look at what happened with FCEL and Exxon). Big Oils conversion to clean energy is going to need to happen - and I'm expecting GEVO to land some partners soon.

I am currently holding 1600 shares at a cost average in the high 9s and feel that GEVO on the low end is $30 by end of year, and $60-70 on the high end. I think a lot of partnerships will start popping up soon and new adoptions in the green energy space by the Biden administration will cause this to really pop."

$GME has to connect with all who own a large enough position within the company, even if they bought the stock just because they like the stock. That shows that the shareholders are more likely to want to help $GME to grow and grow the company’s profits.

The earnings call is tomorrow and SNE will be reporting on the months of October, November and December. The biggest factor is the PS5. The PS5 dropped in November and broke the record for most consoles sold in first month of release, beating out the PS4. [https://screenrant.com/ps5-launch-sales-switch-xbox-compared-most-history/#:\~:text=According%20to%20VGChartz%2C%20the%20PS5,launch%20month%20back%20in%202017](https://screenrant.com/ps5-launch-sales-switch-xbox-compared-most-history/#:~:text=According%20to%20VGChartz%2C%20the%20PS5,launch%20month%20back%20in%202017).

The Sony exclusive Spiderman: Miles Morales was the third best selling game of November and 4th of December. 

&#x200B;

I believe this could produce a pretty huge beat as the expected EPS seems pretty low at .8. For Q3 of 2020, expected EPS was .9 and reported EPS was 3.47and this was without the huge console release and holiday sales. 

Only downside i see is the lack of availability of the PS5 and if that really impacted sales or not. They've been pretty impossible to find as the Demand has far exceeded the supply. But i feel like that only means sales moving forward will be great and guidance will be good. 

I know Sony is more than just a video game company but their video game department has become their biggest cash cow as of recent. With that being said, Sony movie studios had 3 of the top 10 highest domestic grossing films of 2020 with Bad boys for life at #1, the new Jumanji at #4 and Little Women at #7.

SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS FINANCIAL ADVICE.**

Alright guys and gals, I know that the very essence of this sub is meant for circlejerking the massive gains and losses that only the truest ~~gambling addicts~~ geniuses of the stock market have cooked up over time, but most of you need a reality check.

Calm down, gay bears. I'm talking about you too. Put your bear dicks back in your bear pants and listen up.

Here's the reality of the situation: *nobody knows exactly how this is going to play out*. Unless we've got some Ms. Cleo ass motherfucker out there with tomorrow's lottery numbers and the Superbowl results in the palm of their hand, there's not one person who can definitively say how this is going to go.

When you jump on here looking for reassurance of your position, you're going to find that. It's called confirmation bias. If you think GME is going to the moon still, you'll see that. If you think GME stock is about to be sold next to the discount toilet paper and $1 pregnancy tests at the local Dollar Tree, then you're going to see that too.

I probably don't need to tell you that you shouldn't have spent your life savings to buy into a meme stonk at its height. That's just some free general life advice. Since you're reading this, though, let's assume that you did, and you're currently trying to decide between $ROPE and $BRIDGE. Take a breath and calm down. There *is* evidence of short laddering. There *is* evidence that the volume here strongly favors buying. It's entirely possible that they're actually setting themselves up for a massive resurgence.

On the other hand, it's also very possible that this stock is well and truly toast. As much as I've enjoyed watching the comradery around here and the exultation of the truly retarded among us, some of you need to face the reality that there are millions of subs here and only thousands of comments. There are plenty-- plenty-- of people who hopped in at $50 and cashed out at $500. If you think the *only* factor in the steady price decrease since last Thursday is Melvin, then I have bridge to sell you (but please don't jump off it- come on, you can always make more money, but you only get one life).

Do you know why it feels so good to be a part of this, no matter what side you're on? Two reasons: one, social cohesion, which most of us have been missing for a long fucking time because of this shitass pandemic. Two, psychologists have known for decades that unexpected rewards trigger a much higher release of sweet, sweet dopamine and serotonin. When you don't know for sure a good thing is going to happen, and then it does, it literally feels better than when you are expecting a good thing to happen and then see it come to fruition. This is why gambling is addictive. And if this is your first time being introduced to the addiction centers in your brain, well, welcome aboard- hopefully it has been a lesson for you of the good and bad power of your own mind and what it can do.

So again...could GME still moon? Yes. Could it crash and burn? Yes. Both of those circumstances require the right combination of factors to happen. If you're sitting here all day staring at the chart and tearing your hair out-- stop. For real, stop. Close the tab. Go outside. Go hug your wife or her boyfriend and tell them you love them. 

You have already paid the admission price for this ride, so you may as well ride it. If you can't take the heat and want/*need* to sell because you have a life to live, then do that if that's what you need to do. Don't hang on just because some rando on the internet posted some fucking gorilla emojis. On the other hand, if you consider your investment to be money you were truly willing to lose and want to see how this plays out, then that could be fun too. It really *could* rally. It's not over just yet, but you gotta fucking be honest with yourself about your limits and tolerances here. 

Apes together strong, but billionaire hedge funds also strong. Do your *own* research, come to your *own* conclusions, and quit sucking on the hopium/dreadium teat long enough to make a decision on what to do from here.

Edit: forgot my positions: 36 GME @ 99.7, not planning on selling but *I can afford the price of this ride*."

Part of the vision of GME's future is their takeover of the esports industry. It could be a lounge for casual/competetive gaming, a training studio, and of course, a retail giant for all kinds of games, collectibles?, and PC's. What do you need for this? Space. Dave & Buster's already has the infrastructure - hell, they've already done 3/4 of the work for you. All GME has to do is some light renovations/remodeling, add/remove games, and change the signs (what kind of name is ""Dave & Buster's"" anyway?). Gamestop....I mean D&B... also has food/drink, areas for the kiddos to play, and is a spot to go watch live events (MMA/Boxing, Superbowl, etc). More revenue streams for GME.

&#x200B;

PLAY's market cap is currently 1.62B. There are 140 locations (89 currently open from a quick google search). The others are currently shut down due to Covid, so it would be a perfect time to start renovation on those. Many of these locations are in Malls (can't find the exact number). Malls may seem like they are dying, and many of the stores in them are. I believe malls are here to stay, but they won't exist as the retail experience we remember from our childhood. Many malls are still thriving, and those that are have adapted to become experiential social zones, with retail as an added bonus.

Many of you got way too invested in the hype of the idea of a short squeeze and bought more than you can financially handle in the long and short term.

If you really believe in your stock, and love it, and love the movie theater experience and that weird smell when you're walking down the blue carpet with weird little multicolored squiggly lines. And you love the in-person experience of trading in your console games for a dollar and playing crappy demos with the controller attached to a wall. AND love(d) playing brick breaker on the most underrated smartphone ever with that little scrolly ball thing instead of a touch screen, then **trade it as such**.

The stock market has recovered from every major crash in history (inflation-adjusted too) .

If you can't hold, you can't hold- but a great way to ensure break-even is to place a sell order for **half** your shares at, **at least** 2x the price bought at.

for those who have smoother brains than me (impossible) it means this:

""I bought 5000 XYZ shares at $10 and oh shit I need money to live long-term oops""

\- instead of blowing it all when XYZ is $6, place a limit sell order for **at least** $20 for 2500 XYZ which **should** ensure break even **if** it is filled (depending on brokerage fees). Let the other 2500 XYZ ride 'til you die. Obviously, you can hope the price will double in a day, but it's always good to make the limit order GoodTillCanceled so it doesn't expire after a day.

That being said, this is not financial advice cause I have now come to the conclusion that I am a monke

We are in the part of the movie where even long time, fair play market professionals are finding that corruption really has infiltrated every facet of the process. The business of short selling is to feed on death. You make sure you’re in the will, and then you go to work on killing Grandma. The practice has ruined a lot of business hopes, but no one is there to protect Grandma anymore. Even the night shift watch gets a payout. But they over reached this time and someone noticed. A junior player said, why even hide what we do, there is no stopping it, and literally started injecting Grandma right in the middle of the community game time. And they got asked, ‘hey, what’s in the needle?  Are you a doctor?’

There may be a significant loss between 60% and 90%, but you did join the rare opportunity to join a community outcry to require a hard look, and hopefully a correction to an industry that once again is out of control. Hopefully that means something to you. 

I’m thankful that my money was already in position. That I could join this gathering, and that through the worry of losing it all, that it could result in some oversight on a business of promoting a good company by investing in its future, not have its head cut off by the machete wielding bully right out in broad daylight.

1612293405.0,9,WSB POTENTIAL FOR ACTIVISM IN GME?,"As I write this GME is trading at \~$103/sh with a $7.2B market cap.

I'm writing this to talk about GME objectively, not that ""to the moon""  or ""10k isn't a meme"" bullshit or some stupid misplaced crusade against wall street. I'm here to make money.

Right now GME has $586M in CACE ($140M of which is restricted so really $446M to do whatever they want with). Their assets have shrunk most notably from writing down almost $2 BILLION in goodwill over the last couple years. Right now the company has ZERO in goodwill, basically saying it's brand is worthless. I disagree with this after the hype WSB has created for this company. On the liability side, as of Q320, they have $224M and $216M in s-t and l-t debt, respectively, for total debt of $450M.

**GME PLEASE ISSUE STOCK.**

I know it will dilute the shit out of SHs and drop the price but I think it would be a huge buying opportunity. The fact that they haven't already is incomprehensible and arguably negligent. They could've issued 4-5M shares when this thing was over $300 at $200-250/sh and brought in $1B cash. But that's irrelevant now. What they could do is still issue stock, I'm not sure what price they could get for it but I'd be a buyer. Let's say they issue 5M shares at $100/sh, that's $500M cash... $500M would be HUGE in transforming the business. Up that to 10M shares and they bring in $1B. I think $1B is > than $500M but I'm wetahded.

So I titled this ""WSB POTENTIAL FOR ACTIVISM IN GME?"" because collectively we own a shitload of shares. Could we not push for the company to issue stock here? Could we not send a letter to GME like HFs do but with **🚀**🦍🌈🐻💎🙌🏽.

They could use $250M to pay down debt and the other half to really catalyze the transformation.

Video gaming is a growth industry and yes, brick and mortar is slowing dying, but as DFV said in his original thesis, that's a long way off.

GME needs to use the hype that WSB CULTIVATED for its brand and capitalize on it. The company couldn't have asked for a better xmas present than what's happening now. People are buying fucking billboards for GME. The company could be to gaming, what Chewy (a >$40B market cap) is to the pet industry. And clearly Ryan Cohen feels this way, too. GME needs to entrench itself into the gamer lifestyle and I really think raising funds now would accelerate this.

**Financials**

Right now I'm estimating GME will make $5B in revenues in 2020, so we're trading at 1.4x depressed revenues. For comparison CHWY trades at \~6x revenue, per yahoo finance. This is a company that made >$8B in 2018 and 2017.

They recently reported holiday sales (Nov and Dec) of $1.7B, down 1.9% yoy with 11% less stores open. SSS comps +4.8% yoy. But here's the most positive, digital sales were +309% yoy, and $1.35B ytd. As digital sales grow, this should help alleviate SG&A expenses which have historically crushed profitability. In 2017, 2018, and 2019 SG&A was $2B, and for 2020 it's looking like it'll be \~$1.4-1.5B.

**Valuation**

This is a very basic back-of-envelope calculation. But if GME can return to \~$8B in revenues (which is entirely possible and reasonable IF they can execute). And maintains historic GM's of \~30%, we get $2.4B in gross profit. And if digital sales continue to make up a larger chunks of revenues and they close redundant stores, they should be able to keep that SG&A expense under $2B. Let's say they can get it to $1.6B, which is about $100-150M above what SG&A will probably be this year (accounting for store reopenings).

So $8B revenues, 30% GM, $2.4B gross profit, $1.6B SG&A = $800M in operating income.

Assuming \~30% tax rate => $560M in net income.

If this plays out, we're currently trading at \~12.9x ($7.2B/$560M) what could be a reasonable net income # in the next couple years. My point is that GME might not be as overvalued as people think...

Anyways, please call me out on any bullshit in my thinking/logic."

The hedge funds know they're fucked.

Theoretically each share could be worth an infinite amount of dollars. If no one sells, that's the price they'll have to pay. I think it's time these hedge funds billionaires lost their yachts and mansions and have to live in a normal house like the rest us. This is a moment where we're taking back what they took.

Realistically we can probably get $35,000 a share on average. This would put GameStop roughly around the same market cap as Apple. It could go up to $50,000 a share. Anything is possible.

&#x200B;

**Thesis:** 

This Friday and next Monday/Tues is going to experience the drop of all drops for GME due to expiring options being HEAVILY skewed towards puts

&#x200B;

Looking at the yahoo options chain ([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME&straddle=true](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME&straddle=true)) and we end the week around the current price (say, $107):

&#x200B;

Total calls expiring ITM (strike price <= 105) : 16,337

Total puts expiring ITM (strike price >= 110) : 25,797

Net difference : 9460 more put contracts expire ITM, leading to an added **946,000 shares worth of selling pressure** 

On top of this selling pressure, similar to the gamma squeeze we saw on the way up with MMs buying shares as prices increase to cover the calls they wrote, **they will be selling shares as prices drop** to cover/hedge puts they wrote which are now ITM

I have no idea if this makes sense

WallStreetBets has become mostly $GME posts which is understandable because we are in  a  historical battle against hedge funds and every post can make a difference. But, WSB is not only about GME. Some people can't afford it and others don't want to invest in it anymore. So, I **propose making a flair or filtering system** for all new posts related to $GME to preserve  the quality of this SubReddit like it used to be in preWW3 phase.

WSB is much more than $GME and no matter how it ends, we still have other high quality posts buried underneath all of the $GME posts. Have people   forgotten how we raised $AMD and $TSLA from the ashes to what they  have  become today? and there are many other plays like that which we started  right here. **Bottom line is, This community shouldn't be reduced to a GME  only community because it's much more than that...**

That’s why GME and WSB scared them so much. They are beginning to realize their grasp on power is slipping and are going to do it everything they can to take back control. 

Think back to the housing collapse and Occupy Wall Street. Wall Street broke the entire economy by offering as many loans as people would take, it didn’t matter if the person applying for their sixth housing loan was working part time at Wendy’s with $100k in student debt. They were making so much money, they didn’t care, and the revolving door between Wall Street and the SEC meant there was absolutely no accountability. Then comes Occupy, where idealist people came together and said ENOUGH! You can’t just destroy millions of families and then get bailed out for your trouble!

THIS SCARED THE LIVING SHIT OUT OF THE “ELITES”

They saw that the veil was briefly lifted and everyday people that they treated like retarded filth could see the corruption and that the system was corroded from the inside out. They knew that CLASS WARFARE was  coming and soon the plebs would kick out all of them from their ivory towers and rebuild the system to better suit the majority. They couldn’t allow this.

They needed to divide us so that we could be more easily controlled. This is when identity politics and intersectionality began to be pushed in our society and culture. Instead of us being divided between common people and the elites who control our system, we had to be divided based on race, gender, sexual orientation etc. so that THEY could maintain power as we squabbled amongst ourselves. Left and right alike our politicians SOLD US OUT. No matter what you think of Trump, he was a reaction to all of this, not the cause (although he did make the division much worse).

Now once again the veil has been lifted. We can see the blatant lies and misinformation pushed by the media to keep us at each other’s throats. We can see Janet Yellen has made hundreds of thousands of dollars from speaking on Wall Street. That Jen Psaki’s brother is a portfolio manager at Citadel. That Wall Street will manipulate the markets right in front of our eyes and the SEC won’t lift a finger to do anything about it (unless it’s to regulate us retail traders).

The system has been broken for a long time and now that everyday people can see the corruption, they must stop us.

Well FUCK them! They just stirred the hornets nest and we WILL fight back and we WILL win. This is only the beginning. 

TLDR: the system has been corrupt and broken for decades but now everyday people can see it clearly. The elites in power are on borrowed time.

***Of course hold GME*** but it's always a good idea to stay aware of other things that are going on.\*

I am a simple man. I will make a simple case for EXPI. 

1- If any industry is primed for disruption it is real estate brokerages. Information is becoming more and more available. Who the fuck wants to keep paying 6% commission so some college drop out can unlock a door and read some info off of a sheet? Nobody. Real estate agents can go get in the go fuck yourself line right behind the investment firms. We don't need them anymore. It's not 1985 anymore. 

2- Lets look at EXPI and how it's financials compare to two of its peers. Redfin and Zillow.

# Market Caps

Expi- 8.4b

RDFN- 8.2b

Z- 34b

# Net income

Expi- Profitable

RDFN- Not profitable

Z- Not profitable

# Revenue

RDFN's has half the revenue of EXPI

Z has slightly less then double the revenue of expi

# Simpleton's Math

Redfin has half the revenue and is not profitable and yet it has the same market cap as expi.

Z has 4x expi's market cap but only 2x the revenue. And its not profitable.

Even a dumbass like me can see that expi is trading way below the value of it's peers. A fair market cap would be around 16b which would put the stock price around $240. It's currently trading at $120

After a year of lurking in this sub, I've decided that it is finally my time to start a YOLO journey. Now, to make tendies in the future what do we need? That's right, fucking clean energy to cook my tendies of course. I don't want no tendies from fucking dirty oil and pollution, that shit's disgusting. Only boomers eat that tendies. May the power of fresh wind, sunlight, water and energy cook up the finest of tendies for me.

My positions in ICLN:

[My position](https://preview.redd.it/apn4b9fe14f61.jpg?width=946&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67cc6a5415a451605e089ce77e8983d5e818eaa0)

I don't know what the fuck I'm doing but here's my Ding Dong:

* ICLN debuted in 2008 with the highest price of 60$/share during the time of oil fear but quickly got dumped back down over several years. The stock is currently trading at around 30$, only half from the peak.

[ICLN Timeline](https://preview.redd.it/5g9sw9hf14f61.png?width=1224&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ec7ca2c10425c1a5de851872324fa0fe898c8e6)

* **But here's the catch**. Back in 2008, the renewable energy industry was literal trash. The technologies at the time were expensive and inefficient. Miniscule progress was made even with huge subsidies from many countries. Fast forward 12+ years and with improvement in technologies, prices for renewable energy have been significantly reduced -> more adoptions from the average households.

[Prices for various renewable energies](https://preview.redd.it/0um3rmoj14f61.jpg?width=959&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=08b89572ee4e2530ab5bbd396175a73d1eab8d26)

* Many companies in the industry are quickly growing in size and turning profitable. Amongst ICLN's holdings, there are: Enphase Energy $ENPH (which doubled in size from 2018-2019), Verbund AG (largest hydropower provider in Austria), big solar players like First Solar $FSLR, SolarEdge $SEDG, Sunrun $RUN, and some other foreign companies.

* Biden's Green Energy policies include plans to move the United States to 100% clean energy by 2050, boost jobs in the renewable energy industry, and up to $5 TRILLION incentives over the next 10 years. [https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/](https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/)

* Premiums still cheap as fuck with 2023 call options only around $500-800$.

I will be holding this position for at least a year and will be adding more on major dips. I will also update this position monthly to the sub. Join me on this crusade for a brighter, greener, and richer future. This shit literally can't go tits up.

GME Is currently valued at 7.94Bn USD

The gaming industry was valued at 151Bn in 2019 according to grand view research. 

GME made 6.3 Bn in revenue last year with no new consoles to sell. 

Now let’s compare this to Chewy. (You all know about Ryan Cohen). 

Chewy is currently worth 41.76Bn!!!!

The pet care market according to the same analyst is about 150.72Bn in 2019. (Was 131 in 2016 with a CAGR at 4.6%)

Chewy had a revenue of 6Bn last year. 

So what does this mean?????????

GME is fairly valued at 41Bn if not more. 

That translates to 591.92$ a share. 


This is not financial advice yadayada I is smooth brains I just like the stock.

1612291321.0,93,Short Sale Fails in a Nutshell - MM Perspective,"Saw a lengthy write-up about 'shady' short failure coverage tactics so I wanted to update you guys on what that actually looks like in practice for a trader.  This is prefaced by the idea that traders hold stock proportionally against their positions to get **Delta Neutral**, so they are not making directional bets on what stock does.

In situations like GME, traders get extremely short stock through their positions as a result of trading the other side of what paper is doing.  As market makers they have short stock sale exemptions due to their status as a liquidity provider, meaning they can sell stock short in all conditions to allow them to continue trading and 'providing liquidity' in the options markets.  Due to this, they will often encounter a **FAIL** on their short stock position if the short float is big enough and it is difficult to acquire stock.  They are told by their clearing firm that they need to buy in a % of their short position by the end of the day, determined by the size of the fail.

A fail is considered a short term problem for these guys, so this requires a short term solution.  In some cases the traders will get long stock through a **CONVERSION**, where they buy put, sell call, buy stock.  While this seems like a cop out there is an entire market around how they price rev/cons depending on the expiration of the options and the interest rates being charged.

The other main method to get long stock is to **EXERCISE YOUR CALLS**.  Very often market makers will have large call positions as a result of natural trading, and many of these calls can be in the money at the time of a fail.  Due to how expensive it is to hold short stock against these very ITM calls it can make sense to exercise these early, as the savings from the short stock position outweigh the benefits of having the position open.  This is doubly true when you're using the exercise to cover a fail, as you save money by exercising the calls early and prevent yourself from having to make a disadvantageous trade to cover.

Additionally, the market maker may try and prioritize trades in the open market that get them long stock, but that is usually at the cost of putting on trades for bad prices.  This is probably the least favored option for that reason, as it is a long-term solution that is often the least cost-effective.

Now this mainly applies to traders who are short stock as a hedge on their positions, but hedge funds that are naked short likely use conversions to cover a fail as well.  As you can guess from the fact that you're using options to get synthetic short stock while buying long stock to cover your fail, you will still be on the hook when those options expire.  Additionally, this **COSTS MONEY**.  Aint no freebies allowed in the trading world, so whoever you're trading those conversions with is taking their pound of flesh while you're putting a band-aid on your other boo-boo.  If the stock remains very hard-to-borrow and at a decent price level long term you'll continue to make the firms eat shit on their short stock, even if the price doesn't moon in the near future.

&#x200B;

TLDR - covering your fails short term with options still costs money; if you keep holding, they keep paying"
1612291320.0,69,Mark Cuban Reddit on GME🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕,
1612291317.0,668,"To everyone who is panicking, the following words are for you:"," 

All of us have been feeling the ups and downs of this ride and, to be honest, don't forget where it all started and how far we've come. And by 'we' I mean the people who like this stock.

Big hit today, right at the opening. Following this, I had the urge to open reddit and post for the 1st time to make it all clear for you, who obviously feel the doubt about the strategy. Don't feel bad about it, it's normal. You're stading against powerful people who want what we have and will do anything to get it -- starting, as we see, by lowering the prices and targeting stop losses (that you should've canceled already by this time).

But, just in time of Mark's Cuban AMA, I will spoil the message in his own words:

«If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.»

This is the message, this is what I want to say to every single of you retards who are in doubt. It's not all fun and games. Some suits are fighting not to lose billions. We, the people, are disrupting the market. You thought it would be easy?

They are doing everything they can to get those shares in your pocket, that's the only way to cover their naked ass. When people have been saying to **HOLD** this is precisely what they fucking meant. **TO FUCKING HOLD**. **THIS IS THE MOTHERFUCKING BATTLE. PEOPLE DON'T SPAM IT JUST BECAUSE IT'S COOL TO HOLD. NO, IF YOU WANT THOSE FUCKING TENDIES YOU CAN'T LET SOME WALL STREET CORRUPT TRASH PARASITE TO COME AND TAKE IT FROM YOUR HANDS. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO GOT CAUGHT HOLDING THEIR PANTS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL AFRAID AND SELL. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SHOULD - AND ARE - FUCKING DESPERATE.**

You genuinely think that if they weren't scared all of this circus would've happen?

Hold your shares, and, if you can, buy some more. Volume is low, price is in discount. We still have the cheese in our hands. Plus (and correct me if I'm wrong because, you know, I'm a retard as well) they still have contracts to cover. I'm confident we might see the price to rise again today. But even if it doesn't, who cares? You don't pay interests to cover, **patience is key.** Citing Cuban again (damn it feels good): ***«Patience. Disruption is never easy or straight line».***

Guys, one last word: this is the epic journey people have been speaking for months. It's starting to spike (remember VW chart, i.e.). Today we are experiencing one of their last attempts to buy shares from the ones who panicked. This is why people keep yelling to **HOLD!** This is why you should not invest with money you might need, because you don't know how much time you'll have to **HOLD!** This is why you have to know your risk tolerance, to **FUCKING KEEP HOLDING**.

**JUST TAKE A LOOK TO THE MESIAH IT SELF, DO YOU SEE DEEP FUCKING VALUE SELLING?**

MAN UP BOYS, AND KEEP HOLDING THE FUCKING LINE

tl;dr: Given current situation and positive changes implemented by the management team I see $*MACE* having a great future (personal safety and security industry is projected to reach USD 5,5kkk by the end of 2025, registering annual CAGR of 11.00%. Growth is fueled by political changes, worsening climate situation and changes in human behavior). This is one is to hold for long time. I’m not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice.

Longer Version

My investment strategy is finding a stock that will perform well in medium/long term. I usually try to take profits or cut losses within one year, so look for companies that should benefit from what is happening around the world (be it Covid, civil unrests, green revolution, semiconductors scarcity). Today I’ll share my opinion about personal safety and security industry in light of current events.

Guns in USA – Democrats have control, RNA went bankrupt, society at large agrees on stricter gun laws. In near future this might result in policy changes that makes it more difficult for people to get lethal weapons as means of self defense. However, a need for self defense is not going away any time soon and here’s why:

· We have seen that during the recent civil unrest weapons and ammunitions sales skyrocketed. I think that fundamental issues which fueled these events are not going away anytime soon. Portland still rumbling in protests and Q is searching for space lasers… People will want to protect themselves – pepper spray or stun gun is better than nothing if gun laws change.

· Covid lockdowns and restrictions pushed people to spend more alone in the nature. You know who else is in the nature? Bears! Demand in animal deterrent sprays should increase.

· All the talks about defunding and rebuilding police. Sounds like there is a room to expand use of non-lethal weapons in most situations.

· Dating world. Online dating accounts for most dates out there and that introduces risk of meeting some creepy person. Demand for personal safety alarms should increase. Good LinkedIn post on this: **Source 1**

· Climate change creates a lot of wealth disparity that fuels societal disorder. Throw on top of that explosive mix of economical, Covid, political issues and in my opinion what we are seeing now around the world is just the beginning of new normal. Critical mass of anger is achieved and this won’t go down so smoothly. When there’s anger on the streets people look to defend themselves.

In my opinion all of these are external catalysts for personal safety industry. Now about $*MACE*, one of the old timers in this industry.

**Company**: Mace Security International, Inc. designs, manufactures, and sells personal defense and security products to retailers, distributors, and individual consumers worldwide. Brands: Mace, Tornado, Vigilant and Take Down. The company distributes and supports its branded products and services through mass market retailers, wholesale distributors, independent dealers, e-commerce channels, and installation service providers. Headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. [https://www.mace.com/](https://www.mace.com/)

**History:** Founded in 1965, but it looks like company has lost its way at some point – $*MACE* had carwashes as their line of business up till 2013 (**Source 2**). Old management team neglected company’s online presence, so brand and sales suffered. Not much else to say here.

**Now**: new management team since 2019. Has been working on changes and got struck with Covid shenanigans, but is adapting quickly to a current environment. Recognizes missed online opportunities and now is focusing on online sales. Q3 increase in online sales compared to Q2 is in triple digits (meaning 100%+) (**Source 3**, **Source 4**)

Check out their amazon shop – has lots of positive reviews.

When searching for ‘best pepper spray’, ‘best animal deterrent’ I find articles, posts with Mace products. That leads me to think that online exposure has improved a lot and there will be large number of people getting same results when looking for self-defense products.

**Latest Financial Results**: Q3 2020

Net sales increased $2,310,000 or 94% versus prior year, primarily driven by organic growth, addition of new customers both in retail and e-commerce segments and new product line extensions at retailers.  
Gross profit for the third quarter increased by $1,016,000 or 108% over the same period in the prior year, driven primarily by increased sales volume, labor efficiencies, and higher margin digital sales.  
SG&A expenses increased by $177,000 to $1,183,000 for the quarter, or 25% of net sales, driven primarily by higher variable sales commissions and performance-related incentives. Net income increased by $843,000.  
Cash and cash equivalents increased to $549,000 as of September 30, 2020, an increase of $242,000 over the $307,000 on hand on December 31, 2019. Working capital increased by $1,860,000 compared to December 31, 2019. The company paid off its loan in the amount of $600,000 on September 30, 2020.  
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $889,000 (1.4 cents per share on an undiluted basis for the quarter).  
From earnings call transcript: **Source 5** (I recommend to go through it – gives nice outlook on new management team results and their future plans)

**Recent Catalyst**: Protest in US and increased demand in personal defense products, 94% revenue increase in Q3 vs last year, ‘2021 OTCQX Best 50‘ award (**Source 6**), one-year $2.0 million Revolving Credit Agreement with Fifth Third Bank (meaning cash on tap: **Source 7**)

$*MACE* just touched 5 months bottom resistance point. In January after Capitol riots stock soared due to the whole industry (guns, ammo, self-defense) gains. I think that end of the month drop-off is due to people taking gains from speculation on January events.

Summary: I don’t expect here SPAC or pharma level returns, but steady growth instead. Would like to see $*MACE* trade in $1.5-$2 by Q3 and consolidate there by the end of year. It also used to pay dividends, but that has stopped in 2011. Who know maybe good results will reward investors with some dividends? :)

1612291279.0,0,[GME] - Past Week in Review,"Guys, I was a firm believer in the squeeze until I finished my DD last night. I hate to say it, but I think the jig is up and I'll show you my reasoning. In this document:

1. Melvin was telling the truth about covering their entire short position last week (.
2. Why the GME chart doesn't match the VW chart
3. If all the shorts have covered, then why are there no shares available to short?

# 1. Melvin Capital DID close their shorts last Monday

[Melvin Capital announced last Tuesday they closed their short positions](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/hedge-fund-targeted-by-reddit-board-melvin-capital-closed-out-of-gamestop-short-position-tuesday.html). There is more than enough evidence they accomplished this last Monday.

First, check out GME price action and volume last Monday (1/25). I want you to pay close attention to the period between 10am and 11am.

[GME price action and volume on 1\/25](https://preview.redd.it/vn98pna6p3f61.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&s=73b9000a233bd0a522fa6d25c68ea4025bbecc92)

Now take a [Look at Melvin Capital's last reported holdings](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link). From what I can tell, it looks like Melvin liquidated a percentage of their positions across the board. I chose to sort this chart by % Ownership with the thinking that selling a stock for which you have high ownership is sort of a reverse squeeze (you create a large amount of float in comparison).

For their top owned holding (8.7% of shares owned)  **L Brands** (ticker LB), notice the price action on 1/25. They liquidated their holdings from \~10am-11am, which coincides directly with the jump in GME price.

[LB Brands price and volume action on 1\/25](https://preview.redd.it/e99gwq6io3f61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e3b9f78b6892dfadf936a087398917f9d1865e0)

Furthermore, we can get a very rough estimate at how much Melvin raised to cover their GME shorts. From [Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/LB:NYSE) we can see LB volume on 1/25 was 17M shares. If we look across the previous 4 Mondays, the average volume on a Monday is <3M shares. It's likely that when Melvin offloaded their shares, they caused stop losses to trigger and unintentionally caused others to sell their shares, but if we assume Melvin raised the cash from all the sales, they made \~$200M from LB sales alone.

Here's another holding (7.2% Ownership) American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) with the same price and volume action. The volume on 1/25 was 13M vs 3-5M for previous Mondays. Using the same napkin math as above, we get \~$200M netted above average volume.

Extrapolating this across their 119 holdings they could easily have raised the capital required to close at least most of their GME position. Although there is no data on their short position, assuming it was 10x their reported position in GME puts (50M), they could have easily covered the position in trading volume that day (178M)

[American Eagle Outfitters price and volume action for 1\/25](https://preview.redd.it/h75olhmgr3f61.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=0390813919218e2cd528b6737df9bf576f00a22f)

Although I checked for quite a few of their holdings and saw the same pattern, I'm a retard when it comes to making these graphs and I'll leave it as an exercise to further validate.

# 2. Why isn't GME going to rebound like VW?

Most of you have likely seen the below graph used to describe the VW squeeze in 2008. One of the most notable parts about the graph is the massive drop in VW price right before the squeeze - why did that happen?

[Volkswagen AG share price during 2008 short squeeze](https://preview.redd.it/kgnshh3os3f61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdfcad33bff94490b2b0301e13befa602b854673)

[This is a great article I found gives a mostly objective view on the VW short squeeze](https://www.ft.com/content/0a58b63a-4294-3e07-8390-c3aabef39a26) and I think /u/notasabretooth gives a good explanation [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l624yc/why_did_vw_dip_before_the_big_squeeze_in_08/gkxu360?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) The great financial crisis crashed markets globally and VW followed suite - in fact, when VW stock began to fall, short sellers doubled down on their bets as VW was not in great financial shape which caused the very noticeable down spike in the graph above. Porsche had other plans, however, and announced to the world that it had stealthily accumulated shares and now \~90% of VW stock was out of circulation. This caused the sharp uptick and I would point out that there are no further rebounds following the initial squeeze.

Although GME still has many shorts, many of these shorts are likely not the ones that started before the squeeze and instead sold near the top with a much better cost basis. In fact, one of my subscribed newsletters sent out the below sage advice 4 days ago - and if I was smarter I would have listened :)

>""GME is one of the greatest shorts of all time. If you can get the borrow… short it he told me. ""

# 3. If all the major shorts have covered, then why are there no shares available to short?

This was another thing that had not been sitting well with me. If there are no shares available to short sell, then how has the number of shorts decreased? 

First, touching on above - the current short sellers likely have a much higher cost basis and are unlikely to be squeezed like those caught in the initial squeeze. 

Second, it's not clear how shares are made available for borrowing. I found [this very informative article](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investor-education/can-my-broker-lend-out-my-shares-to-short-sellers-without-asking/article32393872/) which gives the meaningful lines of text

>If you want to short sell a stock, your broker needs to call his or her firm's loan desk to see if the shares are available for lending... If the firm does not own it in their own portfolio they have to attempt to borrow the stock from other firms.  As a client of a firm, **your shares cannot be lent out to someone who is looking to short sell**. Shares are held in trust for each client and are kept on separate books. 

If this is true, then the GME squeeze was likely a victim of its own success. By retail investors buying all the stocks, we prevented a continuous short squeeze by evaporating the supply of shortable shares."
1612291212.0,130,"We're still going to the moon, right? 🥺",
1612291180.0,13,TTCF Long and Potential Earnings Play,"I came across an article about BYND where the author suggested that TTCF (Tattooed Chef)  is a competitor to BYND. Now I may be a smooth-brained autist but it seems that TTCF is actually quite different from BYND and has a niche in that it offers other popular food shit like stuff with cauliflower flour substitutes as well as plant-based meat. Also, in case you didn’t know, Beyond Meat’s ingredients lists are longer than your wife’s boyfriend’s dick, and health-conscious people don’t like that. TTCF pushes a more “farm to table” notion that makes its products seem closer to the source, so it also differentiates itself from BYND that way. 

Last quarter's net income was shitty compared to previous quarters (loss of 3.1M for Sept 2020 compared to 916K and 4.88M for June and March 2020 respectively). They said that the major loss last quarter was due to a “non-recurring” expense, which is not unexpected considering these plant-based companies have a lot of innovative shit to deal with in order to scale and preserve food made from natural ingredients that naturally go bad. 

Another major thing to consider is their revenue last quarter compared to BYND: DESPITE THE FACT THAT TTCF HAS NEARLY 1/10 THE MARKET CAP OF BYND (1.65B compared to \~11B ), ITS REVENUE LAST QUARTER WAS ONLY ½ THAT OF BYND (41M compared to 94.44M). 

Also, given that unlike BYND the big institutions haven’t jumped on board for this one yet, there is solid room for growth. Their earnings will be at the end of the month or at the very beginning of March. The last earnings report moved the price up big time despite net loss and this upcoming one likely will too. 

I have a long position as well as 3/19 $30c and  3/19 $25c."
1612291172.0,0,GME IS A FUCKING PYRAMID SCHEME,"GME is a fucking pyramid scheme at this point.

I've posted on here a couple times before, I'm just interested in continuing to exchange quality plays to keep our tendies flowing. If you have any doubts, check out my last DD on $SRNE from a few weeks ago:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky63a8/srne\_to\_the\_moon\_again/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky63a8/srne_to_the_moon_again/)

Now, I know everyone is kinda busy right now with GME, AMC, BB, and the rest. However, if you do happen to be out of those names (or missed the ride and never got in), I have another stock that I would like to bring to your collective attention. Corsair Gaming (CRSR).

I've seen DD about this stock on here before, but it's been a little while and I feel like it deserves some more hype. For those who are not familiar, Corsair makes keyboards, headsets, and other peripherals for use in PC gaming and livestreaming, which is a rapidly growing market, especially in the wake of COVID-19 lockdowns.

Corsair IPO'd back in September, and they crushed their Q3 earnings report. Their quarterly revenue increased 60% year-over-year, and their net income was up **384%.**  They also released full-year guidance, and they expect to finish the year with $1.6B in revenue and $187M in EBITDA. These are huge numbers when you consider their market cap is only $3.4B! At this revenue level, they would only be trading 2X sales, which is not high at all considering the current market and the high-growth industry they operate in. It's also possible that they see a revenue boost due to the recent console cycle. This brought increased attention to gaming equipment, and generated a demand that other major players couldn't keep up with. If you wanted to buy the new PS5 at any point since it was released in November, odds are that you couldn't. I don't really have any data to back this point up, but in my personal opinion, that factor could have lead more people to invest in computer gaming in order to play the new next-gen games that were released with the new consoles.

Holiday shopping season + console cycle + low supply of competing hardware could equal a blowout quarterly report.

After the recent events with GameStop, I am surprised that this stock isn't getting more hype because its situation should be right up this sub's alley. Corsair has about 90 million shares outstanding, but most of those are owned by company insiders until the lockup period expires at the end of this month. Right now, the float is only 25 million shares, and half of that float is owned by institutions and another 2 million of those shares are sold short.

[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crsr/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crsr/institutional-holdings)

In other words, there are only about 10-15M shares available to freely trade on a daily basis. This low float means that this stock can be easily manipulated by the big players, but this scarcity also means that in the event of good news, this stock could fly. Even if enough people try to pile in before earnings, the price could jump $5-$10 like it did last Wednesday. 

Corsair is going to report their Q4 earnings on February 9th, and I think that leading into that report, they could move back into the $40 range. After their last earnings they ran from $21-$51, so another move over $50 is not out of the question. I still haven't figured out options, so I have no idea what strike price or expiration date you should be looking at, if any. I'm playing this the only way I know how, accumulating some shares while it's under $40 and holding 'till next week.

TLDR: High-growth gaming stock could crush earnings next Tuesday. Low float = high volatility, so any good news could shoot it up.

This is **NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**, please do your own research before entering into a trade. Simply presenting a trade that I’m excited about, and I’d love some feedback.

&#x200B;

People that are trading for the first time(s): When we start out we do this thing where we get some small profits (the lucky ones do at least) and then we think without respecting the big daddy in the room that shall later be named: 

""Hey, this shit is easy! I can probably earn conservatively like 1% a day and I will be set for life in X years.""

*Menawhile...*

*Narrator: ....HE COULD NOT.*

&#x200B;

Then, in a stroke of genius we think: ""Ha! I am being greedy, I should be smart. I can EASILY make 0.5% a day and then I will be set in 2X years, but that is fine! Lol... those suckers that don't have any patience...""

&#x200B;

And at every step you find out you really are way shittier at this trading thing than you previously thought. To either one or the other happens. You quit, or the market just whoops your ass so fucking hard with money that your greedy ass could not afford to lose that you actually learn something for a change.

Markets are brutal and merciless my dudes and gals.

&#x200B;

The big daddy in the room I mentioned before it is called TIME. We want things fast and they usually happen slower than we'd like. We get anxious and then that magic button... MARGIN starts seeming like an appealing shortcut. You no longer need to wait for the market to move THAT much, you can have it move 10 times less than that and make the same money. That is another trap.

&#x200B;

Look. I am not an investor. I am mostly a gambler that tells himself he is an investor because I have some sweet REIT dividends dropping in my account every month and once made 130% blindly trading creepto. Markets are brutal and you should only put in what you are comfortable losing. Not just in GME but anything with a short(ish) time frame in mind.

&#x200B;

To answer the post title's question: You most likely cannot time the market going down RELIABLY than you can time it going up. You might get lucky. But don't attribute that to confidence. Anyone can be right on a casino where the bets are only GREEN or RED and nothing else. The thing is being right most of the time, and I certainly cannot help you with that. But if you put the time in, study something for a change and allow yourself to pay ""the market's tuition"". You just might make it.

&#x200B;

Just please, don't believe that you are already there."

(sorry to hijack top comment)

To everyone who is panicking, the following words are for you:

All of us have been feeling the ups and downs of this ride and, to be honest, don't forget where it all started and how far we've come. And by 'we' I mean the people who like this stock.

Big hit today, right at the opening. Following this, I had the urge to open reddit and post for the 1st time to make it all clear for you, who obviously feel the doubt about the strategy. Don't feel bad about it, it's normal. You're stading against powerful people who want what we have and will do anything to get it -- starting, as we see, by lowering the prices and targeting stop losses (that you should've canceled already by this time).

But, just in time of Mark's Cuban AMA, I will spoil the message in his own words:

«If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.»
This is the message, this is what I want to say to every single of you retards who are in doubt. It's not all fun and games. Some suits are fighting not to lose billions. We, the people, are disrupting the market. You thought it would be easy?

They are doing everything they can to get those shares in your pocket, that's the only way to cover their naked ass. When people have been saying to HOLD this is precisely what they fucking meant. TO FUCKING HOLD. THIS IS THE MOTHERFUCKING BATTLE. PEOPLE DON'T SPAM IT JUST BECAUSE IT'S COOL TO HOLD. NO, IF YOU WANT THOSE FUCKING TENDIES YOU CAN'T LET SOME WALL STREET CORRUPT TRASH PARASITE TO COME AND TAKE IT FROM YOUR HANDS. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO GOT CAUGHT HOLDING THEIR PANTS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL AFRAID AND SELL. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SHOULD - AND ARE - FUCKING DESPERATE.

You genuinely think that if they weren't scared all of this circus would've happen?

Hold your shares, and, if you can, buy some more. Volume is low, price is in discount. We still have the cheese in our hands. Plus (and correct me if I'm wrong because, you know, I'm a retard as well) they still have contracts to cover. I'm confident we might see the price to rise again today. But even if it doesn't, who cares? You don't pay interests to cover, patience is key. Citing Cuban again (damn it feels good): «Patience. Disruption is never easy or straight line».

Guys, one last word: this is the epic journey people have been speaking for months. It's starting to spike (remember VW chart, i.e.). Today we are experiencing one of their last attempts to buy shares from the ones who panicked. This is why people keep yelling to HOLD! This is why you should not invest with money you might need, because you don't know how much time you'll have to HOLD! This is why you have to know your risk tolerance, to FUCKING KEEP HOLDING.

JUST TAKE A LOOK TO THE MESIAH IT SELF, DO YOU SEE DEEP FUCKING VALUE SELLING?

The $3.1 billion hedge fund booked most of the gains on its debt holdings in AMC and about $50 million selling out-of-the-money call options on the stock last week, the person said. The shares surged more than 500% in January before retreating sharply Tuesday. Mudrick also profited by selling out-of-the-money call options on GameStop, the person said. A spokesman for New York-based Mudrick declined to comment.

My $10k buy put me up to 84 shares, at an average cost of $300. This was a lot of money for me -- the most I've ever risked on one trade -- but it's not so big that it would change my life if I lost it.

The way I see it, it makes no sense to fold now. In poker terms, I'm pot committed:

For simplicity's sake, I'm imagining only two ""bad"" out comes:

* **A.** no squeeze ever happens, and it goes to $5 -> I wind up with $400 at the end.
* **B.** a squeeze happens, and I'm so dumb I completely miss it, but manage to cash out (or just hold) afterward at $500. -> I wind up with $40k at the end.

Subtract the money I could ""save"" by folding now, and I lose about 9k in scenario A, and make about 30k in scenario B.

Even in this simple ""pessimistic"" model, if I believe there is at least a ~~33%~~ *22%* chance that scenario B happens, I have a positive expected value here, and I should stay in. If I believe the price will go to $1000,  I need a ~~13%~~ *smaller* chance of a squeeze to justify staying, and so on.

edit: (The calculation in this situation is (8600/(8600+31000))... There's a [masterclass article on the pot odds concept](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/learn-poker-what-are-pot-odds#pot-odds-and-expected-value) that explains the idea better than I can.

I think that's pretty much the situation that a lot of people here are in: it'll hurt to lose, but nowhere near as much as it will rock to win. So why would any of us back down?

The \*only\* thing I wish I'd done differently (other than getting in 2 months ago :D) is applying some dollar cost averaging when I bought, and broken it into a $1k purchase every hour. Assuming the ladder attack played out the same way, I would have wound up with more shares. (No ladder attack, and I'd be in the same position as I am now because the price wouldn't have dropped -- or if I missed the squeeze at some point, I might have fewer shares, but I'd still be enjoying the squeeze...)

Anyway, this isn't meant as financial advice. Just something I wish I'd thought through earlier...

1612289354.0,3484,Addressing GME FUD & current situation,"Fellow Mashed Potato Brains,

First – Monke Diamond Hands Banana Rocket Rocket Rocket Rocket Moon

**This is not financial advice. This is speculation based on my limited understanding of SEC rules and documents. Sources linked.**

**TLDR**: My opinion is that Shorts will continue to drive the price down with ladders and try to break the chain of consecutive days where GME is listed as a threshold security. **They need at least 1 non-Failure To Deliver day before EoD Thursday. If they get even 1 day without aggregate Failure To Deliver then the entire 13 consecutive day count restarts. They need 5 consecutive days without aggregate Failure To Deliver to have GME fully removed as a threshold security. Selling is good for them and bad for diamond hands. Ape strong together. Diamond Hands get the Rocket Ship.** No idea if achieving 13 consecutive days will force the squeeze or not.

My opinion is that Shorts don’t plan to cover their position by Tuesday. They don’t have to. Instead, they will drive the price down for as many days as possible and attempt to break the chain of consecutive settlement (read: business) days where they fail to deliver. GME has been listed as a **threshold security** (see below) for 10 consecutive business days (please check my math. I had to count on my fingers). Shorts need to break that chain before it reaches **13 consecutive business days**. “Participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in ‘threshold securities’ if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days.” \[SEC Rule 204\] (link below)

**If diamond handed monke can HOLD strong and reach 13 consecutive days as a threshold security, then the shorts will have to cover the position by buying GME shares or equivalent shares of like kind and quantity. If maths good, that puts Thursday Feb 4th as day #13. Ape hold strong.**

We've seen confusion, fear, uncertainty, and doubt surrounding what happened Monday Feb 1st. Remember that FUD is one of their greatest weapons against retail investors right now. They want to use it to divide retail and to convince people to sell based on emotion. I’M NOT FUCKING SELLING!

Warning: I am not a financial professional or a financial advisor. I read at a grade-3 level. This is not financial advice.

\*Read below here if you can or care.

1. Why no squeeze Monday after $320+ close on Friday?

Shorts weren’t required to cover their positions on Monday. I think that they have T+2 (time of close + 2 business days) to cover their position. If true, this means they have until EoD Tuesday to cover. After that, they will have failed to deliver on the security. That isn’t good for them, but it isn’t as bad as it sounds. Failure to deliver is like a steppingstone in the process. After 5 consecutive business days with Failure To Deliver, the stock is listed as a security threshold. NYSE Threshold Securities can be checked here [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

It takes 13 consecutive days being listed as a security threshold before the positions must be closed (If the rules still apply to them).

So, instead of covering, shorts spent the day driving the price down to a more favorable position for them. They may have scared away some paper hands along the way too.

2. How does that help the shorts?

Lower price means it costs less to cover and the Shorts have more room to negotiate with other funds. A cheaper darkpool buyout is good for them. If they can lower it enough, covering becomes a non-issue compared to a full on squeeze.

Shorts want to avoid days where GME fails to deliver and they want to create non-Failure To Deliver days to break the chain of consecutive failures to deliver. This is easier for them if the price is lower.

3. So squeeze on Tuesday/Wednesday right?

I don’t think the squeeze happens Tuesday or Wednesday. I think the shorts are setting up the next part of their plan. I think if the squeeze happens this week, it happens because the shorts reach 13 consecutive days where they fail to deliver. This means diamond hands and limiting the number of cheap shares that shorts can buy after ladder attacks aka diamond hands.

4. We’ve heard this before. So what?

I agree with the idea that adding RC & friends to the board had a positive influence on the stock price. I don’t think that was the only thing happening when we saw price rise during mid-January. Going back to the idea of 13 consecutive days as a threshold security, we can refer to our NYSE tracker [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

Starting at the beginning of the year, we see that Jan 4th is the first day GME is marked as a threshold security. It stays listed as a threshold security through Jan 15th. Remember we don’t count weekends so the count resumes January 18th. On the 18th, it falls off the list for the day and comes back on January 19th. Without this single day drop-off, the 13-day countdown would have ended at EoD Wednesday Jan 20th. I believe that the price jump we saw can be partially attributed to the fact that shorts NEEDED to avoid another Failure To Deliver or they would risk being uncovered. That was pre-spike. Now they are in a similar position closing in on the 13th consecutive day. They will do whatever they can to avoid that 13th consecutive day because that means they will avoid having their record books searched through by someone outside their firm/fund.

**Threshold Securities**

Def: Threshold Securities are equity securities that have an aggregate fail to deliver position for

· Five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency; and

· Totaling 10,000 shares or more; and

· Equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer’s total shares outstanding.

If you see any mistakes or if I missed something, let me know. Looking to keep this as accurate and up to date as possible.

I decided in August of this year that I needed to take control of my own financial future.  That, win or lose, I should own it.  I bought some regular stocks.  Got my Apple, Tesla, and Amazon.

I learned I liked some digital currencies I can’t mention and got in with what funds I could back in September as they started to climb.  They treated me well.  I started following other subreddits like this one in the background.  I was thirsty to learn and willing to lose some money (and make it if the gods smiled).  I’ve followed the logic with these stocks.  This is all a gamble.  I know that.  What has been exposed to the mainstream is that it’s all a gamble.  I think the “experts” hate that the most.

Aphria (**$APHA**) and Tilray (**$TLRY**) are merging to create the world’s biggest cannabis company. Close to 1B (874M to be exact) in annualized revenues which will only grow.

Anyways the merger states:

“Under the terms of the Arrangement, the shareholders of Aphria (the “Aphria Shareholders”) **will receive 0.8381 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of Tilray for each Aphria common share** (each, an “Aphria Share”), while holders of Tilray shares (the “Tilray Stockholders”) will continue to hold their Tilray shares (the “Tilray Shares”) with no adjustment to their holdings. Upon the completion of the Arrangement, Aphria Shareholders will own approximately 62 percent of the outstanding Tilray Shares.” [Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201216005519/en/Aphria-and-Tilray-Combine-to-Create-Largest-Global-Cannabis-Company-With-Pro-Forma-Revenue-of-C874-Million-US685-Million)

This means Aphria should be trading at **.8381** of Tilray’s share price. Tilray is at $22.50 x .8381 = **$18.86**. Aphria should be trading at **$18.86**, yet it’s only at **$13.95.** That’s a whopping **34%** difference.

Considering Aphria is the stronger company and controls 62% of the combined company, it’s very rare for it to be trading so far away from the merger ratio. I’ve never seen a merger discrepancy like this before. If anything, Aphria should have the premium. Also, Tilray has high short interest so I doubt it will dip as shorts have to cover, it's most likely Aphria should catch up to Tilray's level.

**Aphria/Tilray vs. CGC**

Now let’s compare Aphria/Tilray to Canopy Growth. Canopy did 135M revenue last quarter which is approximately 540M annualized revenue along with a 96M net loss and a whopping adj. EBITDA loss of negative 85M. Furthermore, Canopy has -190M free cash flow, ([Source](https://www.canopygrowth.com/investors/news-releases/canopy-growth-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-2021-financial-results/))

Aphria did 160.5M revenue with Adj EBITDA of 12.6M. This will only increase as their next financials will have SweetWater Brewing on them. [Source](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/aphria-inc-announces-record-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2021-results-890905217.html)

Aphria expected to potentially be cash flow positive either this Q or next. “And we continue to work to be free cash flow positive in Q3, all subject to the intensity of COVID-19 restrictions in the markets where we operate. “

Canopy is valued at **15.8B USD**. Aphria/Tilray will be close to 1B annualized revenue, is EBITDA positive, and is valued at only 4.4 and 2.9B respectively. Not necessarily hating on CGC, the backing from Constellation is definitely solid, but when comparing the two Aphria should be valued higher.

Aphria leads Canada in market share ahead of CGC:  [Source](https://twitter.com/itsdgc/status/1356604397267124235)

Aphria also has a solid presence in the United States thanks to their EBITDA positive craft beer company, SweetWater who sells [cannabis-inspired beer](https://www.sweetwaterbrew.com/brews/420-strain-g13-ipa/).

Lastly, the U.S gov could act on some sort of cannabis legislature soon:

**TL;DR:** Aphria should be trading 34**% higher** than its current SP due to the .8381 merger ratio with Tilray.

If you are interested in cannabis, I believe there is much better value in Aphria/Tilray compared to CGC.

1612288969.0,0,Why holding GME will cause $rope to gamma squeeze,"
Since my last comments got buried, I figured I’d do my autists who haven’t gone full qanon a favor and paint you the bigger picture of how this shit will go down. It’s long so strap in kiddos. 


The squeeze is over. It’s happened. It happened on Wednesday into Thursday when it hit the intraday high of 483. This squeeze was when we fucked over Melvin to the tune of 50% of their portfolio who were shorting at a fucking ridiculous $3 entry. We did it. We won. 


Now where you retards went wrong is you failed to realize that there was a whole new flood of shorts at $400. This is why short interest (more on short interest later) stayed at roughly 60m shares short which is where you get your divine 110% short number. 


This is when all hell broke loose and wall st. did their usual fuck the retails and the poors tactic, and guess what. It worked. It went from intraday highs of $483 down into the 200s for a lot of Thursday and Friday. THIS IS WHEN THEY COVERED. Let’s get one thing straight. Wsb’s greatest advantage AND weakness is diamond handing. You either hold to become DFV or you hold to become the guy who lost 500k on luckin coffee. HFs don’t give a shit about diamond handing. They drool over .001% alpha on volume trading so no fucking shit they’re going to cover from 400 to 200. 


So now the short interest sits at roughly 50%, but probably closer to 30% when you take into account various hedges. It means these new shorts fucked you all to the tune of over 6b when they covered. Daily interest rates are a fucking joke when they’ve made their profits already. The remaining shares short are their yolos. 


Now here’s where you retards really fucked up. You keep expecting the same short squeeze potential when we first squoze. That pressure was legitimate as Melvin was sitting on shorts initiated at $3. Every move upwards fucked them hard. Anyone who’s held ITM options knows the joy of high delta. But you retards don’t realize that these new shorts are initiated at $400. HOW THE FUCK IS RETAIL GOING TO PUSH THIS TO 400 WITHOUT A SQUEEZE? The only reason it got there was the squeeze from the $3 short. Diamond handing at these levels does fucking zero. You fucks need to purchase at 400 - then push beyond that to 500-600 to put any sort of pressure on these new shorts. Diamond handing does literally NOTHING because they’re under no pressure besides laughable interest rates. 


In a way, it’s actually beautiful. You’re all holding OTM options with a delta of .005 with zero catalysts and zero hope for a squeeze. It’s wsb at its finest. At this point, aside from the automated ladder attacks, you’re all just bidding against each other and there’s not enough momentum to turn the tide. One last time for you dense motherfuckers out there - diamond handing does not pressure these new shorts. You need to buy to $350+ and then buy again at those levels. Buying dips does jack shit. 


Now, a quick primer on short interest. The only reliable info on short interest is the SEC report that comes out every 15 days. There are a stupid number of outlets reporting 15 day old (all melvin) figures. Which brings us to the slimy fucks at S3. Yes they have citron-like marketing, but it’s the only publicly available model for short interest. They showed that during wed/thurs, short interest was still at 110%. The problem was that you yards thought it was Melvin instead of the new shorts. They then updated again to show that short interest was now down to 50% levels or 30% if you take into the hedges I mentioned earlier. You can reeeeee all you want, and accuse them of being shills, but just take a look at this price action. Is it possible they’re lying out of their teeth? Sure. But It’s pretty fucking clear what is taking place so just fucking Occam’s razor it you tards. You’re all bagholding for “ideals” and “justice”. If you all want to sacrifice your money to these vampire fucks out of your unwavering sense of virtue, be my guest. Just post some loss porn for the rest of us.

Now I'm in pretty deep and been following the story relentlessly.

Robinhood replaced restrictions on the stock RIGHT AS THE SHORT LADDER ATTACKS STOPPED. They seem to only place restrictions on trade when it goes up, never when it plummets. They're trying everything to freeze the price or lower it at any cost to stop its momentum. Robinhood restricting last Thursday could've been a fluke in market manipulation since they were completely broke and literally couldn't afford to buy anymore stock. But THIS, THIS IS BLATANT MARKET MANIPULATION WITH NO ROOM FOR SPECULATION. They now have ample funding as seen in their stupid ass tweets and the correlation between NYSE stopping short ladder attacks and them placing a max cap on how many GME stocks can possibly buy is just TOO MUCH! They're doing everything in their power to stop this stock and it's actually scaring me a little. If they can pull this illegal crap with no punishment, I've completely lost faith in our free market. I've already filed a complaint to the SEC about this issue and I hope you guys do the same. This war is far from over.

(Edit): I know that exchanges freeze stocks not brokers. Robinhood is contributing to the price stagnation right now (a price freeze in my mind) by putting restrictions on how much you can buy yet again. "

Shut the fuck up. A free brokerage was too good to be true and WSB should have known better. But we didn't. And now we're paying the price of being reliant on an institution which can't or won't support us. It doesn't matter *why* this happened, it did and it will again.

Open a Fidelity account and wire money into it. You could be up an running in a day or two. BTFD and hold. This is a prolonged war on an unimaginably powerful and resourceful institution. It was never going to be all sunshine and rainbows with a victory parade after. It's going to take weeks and it's going to be hard. Think of today not as the end, but as a lost battle where we now know we need to make a strategic retreat. The war is not over.

1612288475.0,58,Theory vs Practice,"Not a bot trying to get anyone to sell or take another position, just a smooth brained autist with a thought... 

So, what we've all seen over the last two weeks is the short squeeze ""theory"" at play. We watched the shorts try to cover, the price came up as it should, the massive buy frenzy, and we're holding. The mechanics of the market at play, and in a truly free market, things were working as everyone theorized they should. Now comes the practice of stopping our ability to buy, gamma squeezes, ladder attacks, etc. The point is, whatever we think ""should"" happen, can be defeated by the simple fact that we're playing this game on someone else's field, and its their ball. 

The theory is that they will have to cover at some point, but do they have to do it in the way we all expect? The evidence shows they do not right now. They have so much power they can get away with dirty tactics to cover their asses. It seems like what ""should"" happen, isn't going to because ***this isn't a fair fight***. 

**Cuban says he would hold, so we hold. DFV looks like he's gonna hold, so we hold. We hold because we want to on our own volition. I'm not selling, and I'm not backing down.** 

But, maybe its time we shift our perspective from ""buy whatever we can and hold, because they have to cover"" to getting down and dirty and fighting them with their own tactics... what that means? I don't know I'm just a retard with a drool bib. We've gone from an active position of being able to buy the momentum and rally, to a passive one. Yes it has been forced on us due to the buy limits and price manipulation, but we can't let that stop us. Lawsuits don't matter, its cheaper to pay fines and settle than go bankrupt. What can we even do? Are we stuck buying and holding? I mean I'm in, I can handle the pressure, but most people bought in really high and are about to lose everything again if things don't work out in our favor. I'm not running scared, I'm a realist the price HAS to come down and stay down at some point. Is now that point? Even if it spikes hard and we see the moon fly by on our warp speed trajectory to infinity, they will chop our knees out from under us to stop that from happening. 

I guess what I'm trying to say, we might have to pivot our strategy and play dirty to actually win this. I'm not advocating anything illegal. This is not investment advice. I am literally retarded as you can all see by the fact I wrote this out and submitted it. Good luck and I'll see you all in tendy town."

You either think you have Diamond hands, and want to know how that happened, or two, you're afraid your hands may be turning into paper and want to know how to stop it from happening. Luckily I'm here to provide some non-investment related advice that you can apply to all facets of your life.

Some smart people a long time ago did a study of some kids. They put a cookie in front of the kids and said ""if you don't eat the cookie, I'll give you another cookie at the end."" Then they left the room. Know what happened? Some kids ate the cookie, some kids didn't. Stocks are cookies we own, in a way. And if we hold onto them and don't eat the cookie now, we get more cookies later.

So what was the difference between the kids who ate the cookie now, and the kids who got all the cookies later? Some kids would stare at the cookie. watch it, Obsess over it like it was their fucking Precious. They would hold the cookie, turn it over and look at the other side, maybe lick the cookie. Their world became the cookie for the duration of that experiment.

Other kids distracted themselves. Hid the cookie under the plate, played games with their hands, some kids took a nap.

Guess which kids ate the cookie before the time was up? That's right, the kids who just watched the cookie the whole damn time. Those kids worked soo hard to have diamond hands, and fucked it up for themselves. The other kids took a break and relaxed and got the extra cookies in the end.

What can you learn from this? Out of sight, out of mind. If you really need to have diamond hands and you're not sure if you can do it, take a break. Unplug. And I really mean distract yourself fully. Disengage. When you're done upvoting this shit close reddit and go for a walk. Don't just stop staring at the ticker, I mean really move your brain onto another topic. If it helps, set a 2-hour timer and only check in 2-hour increments.

It's the minute-to-minute drama your mind will be weak to. It caused me to paper hand at the worst possible minute last Thursday. Of course I got right back in when I could though. But if I had taken a shit or something instead of getting obsessed with watching the line go up and down, I'd be much richer than I am right now.

So learn something from those kids, retards. And have diamond-hands by not even trying. Success is inevitable.

**Edit: TL;DR:**

Smart kids stop staring at the cookie, ended up getting another cookie. Dumb kids obsessed over the ticker all day and paper-handed when things got too scary."

# To win this battle we have to think LONGER TERM here:

HFs can afford to carry their shorts for MONTHS before it becomes truly unprofitable for them. But they are still paying to be in that position. You on the other hand can carry your shares TIL THE DAY YOU DIE and you will get dividends for doing so. 

I know most of you have never seen a floppy disk or tube television in your life but let me tell you something. LET TIME DO THE WORK FOR YOU.

&#x200B;

# Think less like a trader and more like a SHAREHOLDER:

Instant gratification is great but know what else is great? A big fucking I TOLD YOU SO down the line.

Buy the stock. Buy at GameStop. Help their earnings. Arguably you are doing more of a favor to the endgame of this by buying **at** GameStop than buying **GameStock**. Hold the stock like a boomer because while valuations might tell you it is overpriced, fact is that the shorts push valuation UP because in the end they are BUYERS of the stock at some point, and see #1 about time working in your favor...

Go to a boomer mindset. It is the right tool for the job.

# 

# If you cannot have fun watching the whole thing. You probably have too much money on the line...

Kinda obvious ain't it? But here is my advice... if you can't handle the heat. Don't put any more money into it. If you still can't handle it. Be humble and accept that this is not healthy for you and exit at a loss. Mind you, that selling low and buying high is a motto for a reason. 

Go out (to your yard because pandemic), make some love with your hand, go out and then make love with your hands. The possibilities are endless. There is a world out there outside the stock market you know. Just 💎🖐🏻 by default by not looking at your portfolio all day. Set a limit order on pluto if you must to feel at ease. I know I do.

And even if you are not comfortable with buying GME now. Even if you paperhands don't allow you to be in peace with your position. At least go on to spend some of what you liquidate on a GameStop store near you. And then let's watch Q1 numbers rolling in together!"

I do not believe Citadel ever ""told"" RH to stop trading.  That would be so flagrantly illegal that if anything ever came out about it people would actually go to jail.  These people are smart enough to know how to skirt the law so something like that never even comes into play.  I also don't believe they ever had to tell RH to do anything, because they were well aware what to expect.

What do we know about RH and Citadel?  Citadel buys more information from RH than any other customer.  They're also an investor.  I'm not sure exactly what data they purchase/are privy to, but I cannot imagine it does not include a potential liquidity crisis should certain events in the market take place.  Remember how u/DeepFuckingValue was telling us to be aware of increased short activity back in early December as it would be an attempt to drive the share price down?  Are we supposed to believe that some of the most sophisticated financial institutions on Earth did not notice something and start making contingency plans?

Here's what I want to know from Robinhood, preferably in a situation where they're under oath:

1. At what point were they aware of a potential liquidity crisis?
2. What steps did they take to increase deposits on hand once they started to see user movement towards heavily shorted stocks on their platform?
3. Who is in charge of their risk management strategy?  Where was this person during the past few months?

**And finally, the most important question:**

**4) At what point was Citadel informed that Robinhood** ***might*** **be required to limit buys of GME due to liquidity requirements if events unfolded a certain way**

**TLDR:** I don't think Citadel ever had to tell RH to do anything because they already knew what was coming."

* the number of shares sold short (short interest) divided by average daily volume.
* This is often called the ""days-to-cover ratio"" because it determines, based on the stock's average trading volume, how many days it will take short sellers to cover their positions **IF THE PRICE GOES UP**

# EILI5

* a stock has a short interest of 4 shares
* average daily volume of shares traded is 20
* 20/4 = 5 this would mean 5 days to cover

&#x200B;

# What is Short Selling?

&#x200B;

* Short selling is the opposite of buying stocks.
* It's the selling of a security that the seller does not own, done in the hope that the price will fall.
* You can borrow the stock from your broker-dealer, sell it and get the proceeds from the sale.
* **If the stock price declines, you can close out the position by buying the stock on the open market at the lower price and returning the stock to your broker. Since you paid less for the stock you returned to the broker than you received selling the originally borrowed stock, you realize a gain.**

# ^ Bingo

What was the price of $GME last week? It was over $200, over $300, over $400 even...What is the price of $GME now ? $117 and as low as $74.

# If I opened a short position at $300, and closed it out at $74.22 the very bottom of the day.....maybe the price goes up a bit because lots of shorts closed for a profit....and sold to all of you who thought you were ""buying the dip""

Based on Reddit Logic, it's impossible for any other person or company to have shorted the stock after it went above $200. Of course they did, that is an absolutely ridiculous price. Everyone knows what happens AFTER a short squeeze...look at the VW chart. It's easy to understand that a $300 price of GME wouldn't last that long, so if you short it at $300...why would you close your positions now when it will continue to drop? More it drops more you make.   


You all keep going back to the thought that Melvin who shorted at 4, 5, 10 dollars a share...has not covered. What do you think happened when the stock went up 400% last week????"

You really only have 3 options at this point:

1. Make money
2. Make a ton of money
3. Lose money

So how do these 3 come into play?

1. HOLD.  If you hold the shares you currently have, we will climb back up and you will have your tendies.  The squeeze is coming.  The hedgies are beyond fuk right now.  Hold, and sell at $10k.  This was always the plan and still is.
2. HOLD and AVERAGE DOWN.  You already know you're going to make money because the hedgies are fuk.  Want to make more?  Lower your cost basis!  If you bought in at $300, right now the stock is cheap as hell.  If you bought 10 @ $300, and buy another 20 @ $120, your cost basis has now dropped to $180.  In addition, you have now have 30 stocks in total, further fuk'ing the hedgies.  This is the smart play.  The people who will be driving Teslas to Valhalla dripping dip sauce all over themselves while eating tendies are doing this.
3. Be a paperhanded bitch and sell cuz you're scared.  You lose money and have no hope of profiting off the hedgies being fuk.  You lose a ton of karma and WSB calls you a poonanny for the rest of your life.  You will eventually see the massive amounts of profit everyone else takes and you will cry.  Your wife's boyfriend won't even let you smell his taint anymore.

The choice is yours.  I'm in it to further fuk hegdies, make tendies, and aspire to be DFV.  I'll take option 2."

Alright retards, listen up. Move your shares from your broker to direct registration. This puts the stock in YOUR name and not your brokerage (this is the electronic equivalent of a physical stock certificate).  
Meaning it will FORCE them to secure a REAL share. If our theories about the ladder attacks and naked shorts are true (significant counterfeit shares), the 
hedge funds will have a DEFINITE date that they will no longer be able to cover (3-21 days depending on how / when enough shares get moved over), even with the bullshit tricks up their sleeve. And when that happens.... fuck the moon, we're going to a new fucking dimension!

Someone tell me I'm wrong. Until then, fucking **HOLD**. 


**How to move your shares:**

It should be as simple as phoning up your brokerage and having them move the shares to DRS. They will have all the info needed as long as your account is up to date.

After that, you simply need to sign up with the registered transfer agent for GME, which is found here: https://news.gamestop.com/shareholder-services/investor-faqs

I contacted both Fidelity and the transfer agent (https://www-us.computershare.com/Investor/#Contact/Enquiry) and verified all of this. The transfer agent will offer the same trading services as a brokerage,
except they aren't pooling our shares together and you have COMPLETE control over how your share is used. This account would be only for GME. 

In reality once the % of float was moved over we'd start seeing the effects. I'm sure someone better at math than me could figure out the exact % needed.

Am retard. Not fin adviser. Additional DD on this subject in my profile.

Edit: 

More info on DRS ""DRS provides investors with an alternative to holding their securities in certificate or “street” form. Under DRS, investors can elect to have their securities registered directly on the issuer’s records in book-entry form. With DRS, the investor does not receive a physical certificate, instead receiving periodic account statements (at least yearly) from the transfer agent or issuer evidencing holdings. Dividend/interest payments, proxy materials, annual reports, etc., are mailed from the issuer or its transfer agent directly to the investor."""

The GME difference from dotcom boom?

These traders think they are fighting evil.

Don’t give up! Like Braveheart.

This is dangerous emotional trading that can lead to hold the bag to GME $0.

&#x200B;

Yes, it may go to $0.    That's why we're all here.

Sure, HF's were stupid to short GME at $5,

but yes, the dumb shorts were right, GME has stores in malls.   

Dur dur.  Steam means download games

&#x200B;

Now that WSB'ers are underwater, they get to play mental anguish of ""Take losses or hold bag?""

Hope and pray is not a plan.

Stock may never get back to $200.   The stock does not care that you bought at $200.

Insane options will expire worthless and 100% loss on those trades.

&#x200B;

Thin power of masses will save things?

Enron had millions of people supporting it.

&#x200B;

Hold or sell.  Does not affect anyone buy you.

Do whatever you want, obviously.

This will be a good lesson for new traders.

The lesson for new guys is to have a plan.

Exit plan, not just entry plan.

iShares Global Clean Energy ETF is the largest clean energy ETF and has the most liquid options market of any of the ESG funds. Jan 2023 began trading last Monday, and July 2021 and Jan 2022 have also seen tens of thousands of contracts traded almost entirely at highest strike price available ($45) in recent days. 

Why? IMO These options are hella cheap with IV around 50% on an ETF that has QUADRUPLED (from low of $8) in past year with top holding (PLUG) up 1800%+ in past year. 

If ICLN “only” doubles to $60 in next year and IV reverts to historical mean of ~80%, $5.8 options @45 would be worth at least $20 with still a year left to expiry. 

And this $10M is really nothing compared to Trillions in capital already deployed by the US, China, and Europe as part of economic stimulus plans all centered around clean energy (the US joined this wave with Biden’s plan). TRILLIONS in direct subsidies in conjunction with TRILLIONS in quantitative easing by the Fed and other central banks. As just one example, PLUG has completed two secondary offerings in past few months to capitalize on stock price and raise billions to build 5 hydrogen plants, 2 operational next year. 

So in summary while the focus has been on GME etc in recent days, over 10 million dollars was quietly invested knowing TRILLIONS in Stimulus + TRILLIONS in Cheap Money could make for very nice returns."
1612286766.0,461,WSB is being short attacked by hedgies. All of our favourites are under attack and tripped SSR today. This isn't a coincidence.,"It's my opinion that these hedgies didn't liquidate long positions in order to cover shorts just yet, but instead to short all of our favourites in order to pay for the impending squeeze and recoup losses.

Look at AMC, BB, NOK, PLTR, etc. All of them were shorted hard and fast this morning, and once SSR was tripped they setup sell pressure walls to hold that price until they can short into the bid again. *Overcoming this wall requires a lot of buy volume that just isn't there right now, we're spread to thin.*

Remember that SSR is tripped when shorted beyond 10%, and for the remainder of that trading day and the following trading day the shorter's can only sell above the strike. This is also known as the uptick rule. 

It's almost as if there was some kind of backroom meeting to coordinate an effort to short our most mentioned and beloved tickers. A lot of these hedge funds would have shorted BlackBerry when it was at $10, so why wouldn't they liquidate positions in their longs and short it when it is at 22? For those unaware, shorter's make money by keeping the difference between the strike they sold the borrowed chair at and the strike they purchase it back at minus of course fees and interest. Allowing them to push this stuff down is making them money. 

There's strength in unity, let's stop fighting them on 5 fronts, and make them come to us on one. GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

1612286722.0,1602,Dont buy Silver. Stay with GME.,"Alright fellow Monkeys listen here. I found a great quote on [nasdaq.com](https://nasdaq.com) that summarizes how fucked the shorts are going to be.

""Here’s An Example Of How To Short A Stock

For example, let’s say ABC stock is currently trading at $10. After doing your research and due diligence (DD) you think that ABC stock could fall to $5 a share. You will then contact your broker, and your broker will lend you shares of ABC stock that you will then sell in the open market. In this example, let’s say you short 10 shares of stock. 

So, after selling those 10 borrowed shares of stock, you now have net positive $100 cash in your account. Next, ABC stock drops to $5 a share the following week. You will then do what’s called “cover your short position” by buying the stock back. In this case, you buy back at $5. Lastly, you will pay your lender back the shares you borrowed and profit the difference. So with 10 shares as the example, you, as the investor, would profit $50 shorting ABC stock from $10 to $5 a share. 

It’s crucial to note that, despite some investors having made their fortunes by short selling, it’s considered a high-risk investment strategy. The reason being is because short selling has infinite risk. In simpler terms, the amount you can lose by shorting a stock is unlimited.""

What we are seeing today is the HFs trying lower the price of GME in order to scare retail investors. They squeeze has not been squoze.

(insert a lot of rocket emojis, diamond hands and all that.)

I am a degenerate and this is no investment advice. Do your own DD and don't spam me. I increased my GME position today at 80$. But what do I know? I just buy GME and today it was cheeper than yesterday.

EDIT 1: If you want to check my source feel free! According to [nasdaq.com](https://nasdaq.com) the two most shorted stocks to watch are #1 GME and #2 AMC.

Hedge funds seem to think that driving the price down is in their best interest, **it is not.** Here is why.

A short squeeze results from a low availability of shares. The price of the share does not necessarily matter for a short squeeze, and it does not effect the magnitude of an infinity squeeze.

Hedge funds need a lot of shares, and they do not want to buy them for a lot of money. They do, however, have a lot of money. Hedge funds believe that it is in their best interest to drive the price down and scare other out because they are way too over leveraged. **But the price decreasing is actually not in their best interest**

Driving the price down allows retail investors to maximize their ability to hold shares. Once the amount of free floating shares is too low, hedge funds panic much like the VW short squeeze. For the price of one share on Friday (~$330) you could have purchased 4 shares today (~$82). Hedge funds can outpace us when shares cost a lot of money, but we can fight back when they are cheap.

Furthermore, allowing hedge funds to drive the price down can trigger the short sell rule which restricts their ability to drive the price down further. Let them drive the price down, let them trigger that rule and then load up.

Slowly the resources will be out of reach for the hedge funds, and they will have no choice but to cover. That is when you get to name your price, everything in between is just for show.

I am not a financial advisor, nor a professional by any means. All information and discussion in this post is purely speculative and hypothetical. I am retarded. I own GME shares.

With the 20x rise in GME in late Jan, wouldn't funds need to sell off GME in order to bring their weighting back down?

I see 3 major players.  The holders, the shorters, and the investment funds. 

Wsb isn't selling. Maybe even buying the dip.  The shorters eventually need to cover and will be buying.  

So where is all this sell pressure coming from? Could it be from institutional rebalancing?

Looking at whale wisdom and sort by % of portfolio.  That percentage shot up for all these funds by 1/31, and they all hold tens of thousands of shares. 

Would these funds be forced to sell off large chunks of shares to bring their % of portfolio back in line with what it was on 12/31?"

Mark Cuban's AMA also put light on one issue: HFs won't want to close their shorts. Their plan is to drag this and leverage their sheer size on us. But we can beat them at their game by buying more and more shares at these lower prices. But don't despair if prices fluctuate under 100, under 80 or even under freaking 30. The more shares we can gobble up, the better.

Just remember:

&#x200B;

1. Only risk what you can afford to lose.
2. This can drag on longer than any of us initially believed, so BE PATIENT. If you can't buy more my advice is to just go do something else. Forget about it. Remember rule #1? You only have money you can afford to lose in this, so why the rush?
3. Help out by upvoting good ideas, topics, doing DD, motivating people, being funny and generally entertaining. It all helps.
4. Have some fun. If you cannot have fun you probably have too much money on the line.
5. (Optional) - Instead of a trader's mindset. Adopt a Shareholder's mindset. You own a tiny bit of GameStop now. Go ahead, buy on their stores. Lift their business up and when Q1 numbers come out it will be a great deal of help for them."

Anyone STILL using RH can confirm that Robinhood lifted the restriction around that period?

1612285114.0,280,"All ""WSB stocks"" are being treated the same by the media. They're not the same.","The media has been covering WSB absolutely atrociously. WSB stocks have been rising and falling together for days now, even though they are very different stocks that people are in for very different reasons. This has the potential to create some bargains. I wanted to do a quick rundown for those who are unclear on why. The stocks I'm going to cover are GME, AMC, BB, NOK, and I'll touch on SLV (and why it's not a WSB stock)

**GME: The squeezening**

GME was trading at $4 a share 6 months ago. People on Wall Street were treating it like it would be the next Blockbuster. The fear was the people would buy their video games online and make the company obsolete. Hedge funds started heavily shorting it, expecting it to go bankrupt within a few years. Even if it was, 138% short interest is insane. They were asking for a squeeze. 

Also Gamestop is not that much worse positioned than any other brick and mortar retailer. The pandemic cost them in the short term, but they can survive. Is Macy's going out of business because of online shopping? Maybe eventually, but for now they're trudging along. Gamestop even has some advantages over other retailers, in that they can buy used games for pennies on the dollar and resell them for dimes on the dollar. If you do that with clothes you're a goodwill. In other words: **we like the stock**

There was really good news concerning vaccination, so the pandemic sell-off started reversing. As the stock price came back to pre-pandemic levels, Ryan Cohen joined the board (previous CEO of Chewy) there was hope for the future trajectory of the company. This absolutely screwed the short sellers, leading to the short squeeze. Gamestop has become a short squeeze play. It's speculative right now. It won't be worth $500 a year from now, and no one believes that. But it also won't be worth $4 a year from now. 

**AMC: GME's little brother**

AMC has a similar story to GME, except less hope. The cinema industry has been decimated by the pandemic, but that doesn't mean that the company is closing imminently. The company became undervalued, and with hope that the pandemic was coming to a close, the price started coming back to pre-pandemic levels. Short sellers got caught with their pants down. They got squoze, and lost a ton of money.

AMC is different that GME in that cinema's were having huge problems even before the pandemic. Also unlike GME, there is no e-business guru joining AMC's board. I think GME has hope long term, whereas I am much more skeptical for AMC. The short squeeze means that the stock will have crazy volatility in the short term, but long term I'm not sure where it ends up.

**BB: Not GME**

Blackberry is known for making cell phones for boomers, but they have shifted dramatically. At this point, Blackberry is a cybersecurity company:

https://marker.medium.com/how-blackberry-yes-that-blackberry-became-a-cybersecurity-company-efae02912751

BB is also interesting because they are really involved in the cybersecurity of self driving car technology:

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackberry-software/blackberry-launches-cybersecurity-software-for-self-driving-cars-idUSKBN1F42LX

And with the solar winds hack, they were listed as a possible beneficiary. 

Blackberry has a partnership with Amazon, and has partnerships in China as well. BB is nothing like GME or AMC. It's a medium risk high reward stock that could hit $100 within 5 years or could do nothing. 

**NOK: Definitely not GME**

NOK is similar to BB in that people think of them for their phones, but they... don't do that anymore. NOK is a 5G company now. They have 2 major competitors in Europe, Ericsson and Huawei. Yes, that Huawei. The one that no one trusts because they are probably selling your data to China. It is likely that Huawei gets regulated out of Europe, which is a gift to Nokia. The company has partnerships with T-Mobile and Google:

https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/nokia-nok-secures-key-deals-145002461.html

Nokia is a low risk medium reward type of stock. It's trading at around $4.50 right now. I would be surprised if it didn't hit $5.50 by EOY. But I would be just as surprised if it hit $9. They look to be giving out a consistent dividend, which might bring some big pension accounts on board. 

**SLV: Not a WSB stock**

I think I saw 1 post on SLV here, and suddenly it is a WSB stock in the media. Someone posts here about SLV every once in a while, talking about silver to gold ratios or some shit. SLV is a scam. SLV does not create value. It's a commodity. Institutional investors are all over it. There's no law that says it has to have some ratio to gold. Literally the first law of the stock market is that past performance does not determine future results. 

Notice how SLV is the only stock out of all the ""WSB stocks"" that is not trending together. GME, BB, NOK, and AMC are wedded to each other even though they are obviously very different. SLV does it's own shit. I really think this SLV thing was just a way for some hedge fund to cover some sneaking shit they were pulling.

**ALL THAT SAID**

If GME or AMC crashes after the squeeze and that leads all the other ""WSB stocks"" to crash, BB and NOK present huge opportunities. I personally am going all in on NOK if it goes under $4 a share. 

**TL;DR**: GME and AMC are short term, high risk, high reward short squeeze plays. BB is a longer term, medium risk, high reward play. NOK is a longer term, low risk, medium reward play. FUCK SLV."

Long-time lurker but decided to post because we need to keep this sub fun and bring positivity!

I've  truly enjoyed this sub over the last few years and at first I came for  the memes (guilty) but stayed for the community. As with most of the  world and especially the US life has been pretty challenging  over the  last year.  For me, that's meant an anxiety and depression cocktail  which not even my wife's boyfriend could help me get out of. I stopped  caring for myself and caring about anything really and although I keep  trying to do my best nothing had been able to get me out of this.

That  changed two weeks ago when my friend and I decided to go in on GME and  just see what happens. I went from checking this sub a few times a week  to pretending to read nearly every quality post and the excitement,  banding together, and support I have seen and felt over the last 2 weeks  have been amazing! It jolted me back into caring at least a little bit  about myself and life. It didn't solve the challenges I face but I feel  more alive than I have in over a year and it has helped me see I can get  out of the dark place I was in with some help and putting in a little  effort each day to change my behaviors.

I  appreciate all of you (Not you paper hands though) and please drink  water, exercise, try and eat healthy, and take time to disconnect once  and a while. Care for the people in your life and any strangers who are  not billionaire hedge fund managers or billionaire wealth hoarders.

1612284814.0,137,GME valuation,"This is not financial advice (maybe we need to change some laws if we have to always write these disclosures)

I’m a former financial adviser that left the business back in 2012 because I was tired of the manipulation by large institutions. The game is rigged but understand the game if you are going to play.

What is GME worth- for all of you that like the stock. I think what you are saying is that you like video games, and the culture around gaming, and you want to support is a company that promotes those ideas. I can fully get behind that. And I can hope the GME management took the run up in stock price as an opportunity to bring some of your new capital in, and continue to restructure and develop a really amazing company around the future of gaming.

At some point though the price of GME stopped being about GME fundamentals or even a restructured growth story and started to be about a short squeeze. A very valid reason to buy the stock. Watching this all play out I noticed there was a point that short interest stopped going down. Institutions are sharks and will sell their grandmothers for a few dollars but many belong to larger entities that are not about to let a small trading arm take down their whole company. When the shorts stopped covering it wasn’t because they were continuing to hold onto their losing bet. But it was because they had already lost. The legal entities and their clearing houses holding these short positions were already theoretically bankrupt. It did not matter what the overnight borrowing costs to short the stock were and it didn’t matter what the price went to if the entity was bankrupt at $300, it is not More bankrupt at $400. You can be right about bankrupting some Wall Street institutions but still lose money if you are paying more for your trade than you will ever get back. My theory on the trading range over the past week is that some long side institutions said it wasn’t worth owning over a certain amount and were willing to buy at maybe $150 but wanted to sell at $300 (these numbers are theoretical). Bankruptcy payouts take a long time, and if your money is tied up waiting for a bankruptcy judge to approve who gets what money... well that can take years. Not ideal for portfolio returns.    Summed up there is some value that can be extracted from the shorts but that dollar amount is not infinite. There is an upper bound on the short squeeze price.
Also, and this is more speculation the longer this goes on the better Wall Street will be at extracting value out of the bankrupt institutions and shifting more risk to the bankrupt entities, and unwinding risk off of the other entities. If you are bankrupt you don’t borrow your last dollars from your credit card to put it on black, you put it on fucking 17 and hope the payout bails you out. And if you and your friend are both in trouble you talk your friend who is already bankrupt into borrowing a few more dollars (because no one can save him anyway) and “giving” you that money so you can get out debt.

I bought some GME this morning because it felt like a good gamble and my guess is that there are still some shorts value in the short entities"

Today is February 2nd, the hedgies thought Groundhog’s Day could be used as a cucking mechanism against us retarded apes. They should’ve known better than to fuck with us. As an owner of GME, BB, NOK, AMC and Blockbuster, I know how shitty today has felt for a lot of people.

BUT THIS IS WHERE YOU LISTEN. To all the new investors that have just joined this sub over the last week and a half: Buy, the fucking, dip. It’s really that simple. So when I was eating crayons and having not fucking a groundhog five years ago, my novice dumbass investing brain thought you sold to save anything you had left - that was WRONG. Instead, when you buy more shares at a lower price, you LOWER YOUR COST BASIS.

What does this mean?

It means if you bought 10 shares of GME at $300 and then bought another 10 at $80, your cost basis is $190. Essentially, you’re not only lessening losses but you now have the potential to make even sweeter tendies. Now, when the price goes back up to $300 (which it will, because we are lubing that groundhog anus), you will now have a gain of $2,200. Yes, you’re buying more shares, but you’re now getting better value. That’s what fucking matters.

*TLDR: Buy. It actually makes things cheaper in the long-run during rebounds and can make you richer. Panic selling will only hurt you more.*"

First, non of this is financial advise&I'm not a financial advisor
Secondly, I'm not sure if this fits in DD since this is more psychology so mods please correct the flair if I'm using the wrong one.

That being said:
I know y'all retarded apes don't want to read, but bear with me here. 
The current fact we all first need to acknowledge is that the price of GME has dropped significantly, and that the volume, albeit still low, is higher than yesterday to say the least. People have started to sell, and other where on Reddit people are starting to belief this thing is all over and we're a bunch of cultists.
Now the question I know y'all want to know: Is it over yet?
Short answer:Likely not, but it depends on us.
The very basis of the reason many of us believe GME with go to the moon in the first place, that it is HEAVILY shorted, *still holds true*. According to the volumes for the last few days, the restrictions still going on, and the media fake-silver hype, the HFs likely haven't covered their positions yet. Many of them likely even added new ones, as they believe the price is going to fall. The potential for going to the moon is always there, it never changed. What has changed, and can potentially truly wreck this spaceship, is our mentality. Due to the price drop, which, started with the HFs with their dirty tricks, people are starting to panic, and this panic, which is caused by a false manipulation, CAN wreck GME. People are less likely to buy in as they're afraid this is not ending well, and people are more inclined to sell due to the dropping and seeing all the other people selling.
*Spamming 💎🙌💎🙌💎🙌 will NOT stop people from selling or panicking. It only serves to make them think we're a cult*

*What to do*
What is important as of now, whether you're still in, already sold, or has been speculating the whole time thinking this is over and all these poor cultists are going to end up in shit. Is to understand, and not just blindly belief, that *the stock is still heavily shorted, and this fact NEVER changed*. If we all understand this fact we *win*. The only potential source of this failing is our doubt amongst ourselves. I urge everyone to take a deep breath, and ask yourself: *Do you really belief that the HFs are truly out?* If the answer is no, than the best thing we can do is to recollect ourselves, regain the faith(which should not be blind faith but faith backed by reason) we had in each other and in this stonk, and HOLD AND BUY. 

TLDR
*Our whole reason of doubt is our own doubt. The entire thing is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If we all believe we win we win, if we all believe we lose we lose.(Yes this includes you bystander, we are all in this together) The fundamental reason the we believed GME is going to the moon has NEVER changed. HAVE FAITH that is BASED ON REASON. Blind belief is NOT solid, and can only get you so far*.
The stock is at a low, and this is a great opportunity if you sold earlier to get back in again. If we come together and have faith in reason, we have a greater chance than EVER to send this to the moon, wreck Wall Street, whatever you're in this for at the beginning.
*Unity and belief in reason, not fear, makes us strong*
*GME TO THE MOON BUY AND HOLD*

To rebuild faith in reason: 
-Welcome discourse, don't call everyone a bot
-Actively engage in discussions and focus on the fact that the stock is still heavily shorted as ever
-Spam less emojis, more rational discourse, appear more collected so people don't think we're a bunch of crazy cults sinking with the ship"

1612283647.0,102,GME and a rigged horse race,"Your friend just got the hot tip on a race horse who is a sure thing and you think fuck it... why not.

The bookie you use takes your bet and prices the horse 25/1... the horse wins the race by 75 lengths and you’re convinced it’s worth betting again.

The next race, the horse comes back and for some reason the bookie didn’t even bother to price the odds correctly and prices the horses odds at 20/1.
You take your winnings from last week and pile it all on your favourite horse to win again.

This cycle continues for a few weeks until you’ve taken your initial sum of money and cleared out the bookie for hundreds of thousands, millions perhaps.

This weeks race comes up and the bookie realised how much money you’ve made from this one horse and decides he doesn’t want to live with that kind of a loss to his balance sheet.

You place your bet with all of your winnings for this weeks race and again, the horses odds stay the same.

The bookie then makes a trip to the racecourse where your horse is, pauses the race and starts to smack your horse with a baseball bat to its legs for a while and then finally lets the race proceed. 

You lose your bet, all your winnings and the bookie is back to where he started because he couldn’t face having to lose all his money.

If this was a true story, the bookie and whoever helped him set this whole incident up would be sent to jail for defrauding the gambling industry and fixing the outcome of a race.

Read the article if you’re still mad at all these brokers for limiting our ability to buy, because frankly, if anyone can win this lawsuit, it would be the Joseph Saveri Law Firm.

Now, I got this news from a lawyer myself, so I’m not exactly sure about this, but at the end of the article it states “Plaintiffs seek to recover damages, as well as injunctive relief, on behalf of themselves and the proposed class, from the defendants.” Based on lines near the beginning, I assume this “class” is any retail investor invested in any of the 12 companies’ (YES, 12) stocks mentioned??

You bet they have multiple billion ideas to turn around the company.

So, what to do? Well, you fucking buy and thank your wife's bf for keeping your wife away from distracting you to seize on this opportunity to buy. Because soon enough, you would fucking regret not buying, similar to how you fucking felt when the price was 500+ and you are sitting on a sorry ass amount of shares.

>(...)I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the  more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only  question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going  to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a  group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont  cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.

And last but not least...

# 4) Seems that pushing for Market Manipulation and counting on the SEC is a dead end:

4) NOT SELLING = NOT LOSING. (yes, you may have loses and are RED but they’re UNREALIZED LOSSES). You DONT lose until you SELL.

Just like last week, we are under a low-volume short ladder. And just like last week, bulls are hindered by brokerages' restrictions.

However, a remarkable thing happened today: GME tested a previous ATH/resistance ($76.76). GME first pulled back from that price point on Jan 21st, when the price opened at $42 and closed in the $60s. It was the first day ever trading was halted intraday, and our first massive win against hedge funds. $76.76 slapped us in the face and called us his bitch.

**So, why is today's price action bullish?**

Because when a stock tests previous ATHs and it **BOUNCES OFF OF THEM**, thus turning a resistance into a support, it's a sign that the stock is still healthy and has potential for an even more powerful run. **PLTR did that, NIO did that too in the past.** They went sky high (not as GME duh), tested previous ATHs, then kept flying to their own moon trips.

Now look at GME recovery.

And imagine how high it's going to fly again once brokerages let us monkeys out of our cages by lifting restrictions. Yes, GME could test the $500 resistance again after testing the $76.76 resistance now turned into support.

Guys, I don't have the vocabulary to explain how bullish this is in my opinion. I am blessed I can buy GME on my broker, looking forward for an amazing run through Q4.

**To GME newbies: this has always been a Q4 play. I was expecting the squeeze to happen after Q4 ER revealed what a powerhouse GME is, and I still do. Accumulate, hold, squeeze, cheer.**

You saw some deep red in your portfolio today and got scared as it kept going down in the morning volatility. You probably felt fucked... Then when it kept going, you just had enough and **sold**. Through the constant preaching of ""holding the line,"" you left your position and ""realized"" your loss with hands made of papyrus.

In all seriousness, this isn't to shit on you or say that you failed your part. Chances are, if you're reading this then you're in need of some help (or you know someone who does need help). The reasons you may have had to pull the sell-trigger are none of our business.

What you just experienced is what I like to call **""Market Tuition.""**

Now that you've solidified or ""realized"" whatever loss potential you may have had, here is some advice to help you accept the loss and move on.

# 1. Try not to get caught up in thinking about the past.

What's done is done. You've made your position and settled your exit. The less you think about it, the faster you can recover both mentally and financially. Consider a break. Do the shit that makes you happy and distracts you far away from the market.

# 2. Consider what's left, look at what's ahead

Look at what you have left. And if nothing else, assuming you have a source of income, it may bring you some solace knowing that you can file [capital loss tax deductions](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/100515/heres-how-deduct-your-stock-losses-your-tax-bill.asp) (3k annually until net breakeven). In some ways, you can say that the government is taking on the weight of your loss.

# 3. ""It's just numbers""

It may be difficult to look at your portfolio and see it as ""just numbers"". After all, these ""numbers"" could have taken you months or years to accrue. But the more you simplify the event, the better you can accept what has happened.

There was a larger number in your portfolio, now there is a smaller number. That's all it is.

# 4. Close the position? Close the chart.

Stop looking at the stock chart. Plain and simple. Prevent yourself from regretting your decisions. If you are no longer in the position and are not considering a new one any time soon, then it's probably best to distance yourself away from any reminders of your loss.

# 5. You lost money. But gained experience.

This is a cost of learning how to feel the market. Not everyone is born with diamond hands. Many people, just like you, second-guess their positions. Even the most experienced investor can doubt his/her securities. But if nothing else, the market teaches discipline. What could you do differently next time? Did you have a game plan? If the answer to that was no, I'm sure you'll be less likely to go without one next time.

Once you've considered all of these steps, then you're already well on your way to recovery. I'm not gonna tell you how to use your money. But consider this advice from someone else who has [seen loss](https://ibb.co/n7m8nzx).

I've spent the past year recouping loss. And finally, after all this time obsessing over charts and news, I broke even last week. It was a combination of a small steady income and investing my small positions into stable growers until I had enough to do larger option plays. And by that time, I was much more prepared.

Money will come and go. Are you going to waste your time thinking about it?

Or will you start your journey to recover losses and break-even as an even better investor.

You can make it back. Godspeed."

1612282926.0,161,"Start Playing Towards Your Strengths, and Stop Acting Invincible. Much like GameStop, WSB Must Return to Their Core Competencies to Succeed.","Listen up retards, and most importantly new members, it is important that you actually read this post and others. I know it’s a joke around here, too many words can’t read, I get it. Information is a valuable weapon, stop voluntarily ignoring it.

I am not a financial advisor, I just like the stock, and that is why I am going to provide some insight into how GME arrived to the position they are in, and how WSB arrived to the position we are in now.

**GameStop Backstory**

I will briefly cover the backstory of GameStop, but for more accurate information and in depth discussion I recommend you listen to Rod Alzmann’s GME DD as a guest on the Modern Guilt podcast found on Spotify. 

Essentially, GameStop began to slip as E-commerce grew and management went through several changes before arriving at what we have now. As a result, earlier management tried to pivot away from GameStop’s core competencies (large user base and trade-in/second hand sales) which pushed it further into misfortune. Eventually the board we have now chose to double down on their core competencies and improve upon them rather than restructure entirely.

**WSB Backstory**

Leading up to the now viral GME bonanza, this sub and the strategies used were much different. GME started off as a value play, although a significant subsection of that following always had their eyes on a potential squeeze play. The following was small at first, but grew as GMEs potential grew. The core competencies of the following consisted of excellent DD, knowledgeable users willing to share research, and less knowledgeable users willing to learn.

I no longer feel as though this is the core competency of GME gang, the strategy has shifted towards strength in numbers and raw unadulterated conviction. That is not a bad thing and I will get to that later.

Once the GME squeeze became apparent and the sub was soon consumed almost entirely by GME gang, the original competencies actually flourished. Users provided excellent research on the mechanisms at which hedge funds could be held at bay in the midst of the squeeze. The prevailing strategy was to buy shares only, never use margin or over leverage yourself, and not to purchase options. 

Those competencies were what made WSB unstoppable in the begging, and they were based on pure reason alone. Buying shares would reduce float and put pressure on HFs, avoiding margin and over leveraging would prevent users from panic selling or liquidating due to margin calls, and avoiding options would concentrate power into a strategy that gave hedge funds little wiggle room.

These strategies worked, and you can check the first week and a half of the GME movement to confirm that it was rock solid. But then something happened, people saw opportunity and started buying options on the side or completely instead of shares. Because of the original momentum this actually ended up benefitting the strategy significantly, it resulted in all calls ending ITM on the Friday before last week, it produced a gamma squeeze.

But that tactic is short lived, the MMs quickly started writing a vast spread of options and priced many users out with premium. **The options strategy is no longer feasible in the near term, momentum is gone and the options ladder spreads traders too thin.**

I understand the allure of options, but just consider the amount of money that vanished last Friday. Calculate the cost of all of those options from $330-$800 and consider how much ammo was wasted. Yes, it was stolen form you, it wouldn’t have happened if not for manipulation and brokers blocking GME buys, but it is time to adapt and overcome.

**Return to your core competencies, and improve upon them. Stop ignoring thorough DD and stop neglecting to do your own, do not allow your fellow members to post information without scrutiny. Return to the original thesis**

**Improve the Core Competencies**

We are in a grim stage of the squeeze and many are nervous, but it is essential at this point to steer into the skid. **If you read anything in this post it should be this.** The stock price falling gives us strength if you look past the fear. The squeeze is about leveraging the small amount of float that is urgently needed by hedge funds. Hedge funds have an abundance of money, but they lack the volume to close their positions. Individual retail investors lack money but they are capable of leveraging the scarce volume available against HFs. 

Think about this, HFs are burning money to drive the price down but they need shares to stop bleeding. When the price is low, retail investors become more capable of obtaining shares. The price being low puts HFs in a **bad position**. At low prices retail investors are able to hoard large quantities of shares, further increasing the scarcity. For those of you who bought or are willing to buy at $250, $300, $400 etc, I salute you but I don’t encourage this behavior. 

Buying high spreads your resources thin and results in diminishing returns. **Let them trigger the short sell rule, let them give you a discount**

A squeeze can start at $1 or $1000, it doesn’t matter, and the base cost of the stock equally doesn’t matter in an infinity squeeze.

Return to your core competencies, allow hedge funds to bleed themselves dry in their effort to deter us by lowering the stock price. Buy when the price is cheap, allow it to inflate naturally, and wait for it fall again before loading up more. Once the resources are entirely out of reach for the hedge funds, there are three ways to win. A positive catalyst, natural price growth, or simply allowing them to bleed themselves to death.

Options are no longer effective, consolidate your efforts.

Do your part to spread and scrutinize important information. 

Stop slacking and letting others pick up the work for you. If you’re still on Robinhood, set up a fidelity account or an alternative immediately. If you’re still on margin take it off. If youre still allowing your broker to lend your shares call them. Get extended hours trading. Get off toxic brokerage platforms.

Return to your core competencies and stop running in circles.

I am not a financial advisor, nothing in this post should be used as investment advice. This is my take on a purely speculative situation, and I recommend you do your own research before entering or exiting any trade. I like the stock and own GME shares.🚀🚀

**TL:DR: for starters, stop slacking off and actually read DD posts, information is essential in warfare. Stop buying options, they were an effective weapon that was purposefully neutralized by MMs and now works against us. Return to the strategy that got us to this point.**

**The price dropping allows retail investors to maximize the effectiveness of the only weapon they truly have against HFs**

We have to FIGHT for this to work out, it’s a fucking blood bath— but don’t fucking trick yourselves into throwing a pity party like it’s only your blood being spilled. You’ve now seen how the game is played, how it’s rigged, how it’s contorted and drawn out and galvanized to benefit the other side of the trade desk. We are out here fighting the short battle of fucking Thermopylae and some of you are losing interest? Losing hope? Losing attention? Then fucking clear out, we don’t host fucking pity parties on this sub. 

The camaraderie and bonding that I’ve seen on this sub in the last few weeks, even with all the newcomers, has honestly been something I haven’t seen here in this magnitude before. We’re here together, we’re fighting this together, we might as well stay in this together. 

And if there’s anything I needed to see to restore the little bit of hope that was starting to falter, it was Mark Cuban’s AMA. We CAN do this. We have BEEN doing it. *They’re fucking scared.* We’re fucking scared. Folks at home on their couches are fucking scared. Stop pretending like your worries & fears are singular or unique to you. It’s fight or flight time, so either hold the fucking line with your brothers and sisters, or shut the fuck up and post your loss porn once you sell.

In my opinion, $BB got wrapped up in this $BANG phenomenon and is being attached to avoid any further losses by Big Money. There is so much good going for this company right now and $BB discussion has been relatively quiet. This dip is an absolute discount fire sale right now and although I am not a financial adviser and do not offer this as advice I am definitely thrilled about the buying opportunity and will definitely be capitalizing on it. Although I have been a member here for a short period and only trading for a few years now, I like to think I know a solid value play, especially in tech thanks to you smooth brains, when I see one. 1 - 3 years and this stock will make the difference between retiring comfortably on time and retiring early with excess spending money.

1612282277.0,0,We all need to learn from this,"(Before you downvote please read)

1: The most important point is you cannot beat the big guys, it doesn’t matter one bit, you will not win. They have the politicians, brokers, and market makers in their pockets, you can’t win at a broken game. The only way to make money is to ride their wave because as we all know, they always win, or to play something that they do
not know of and have no desire to dabble in.

2: WSB has grown exponentially in the past week or so, and for everyone who is new, this does not happen often. There is usually a meme stock such as TSLA or PLTR, but these do not boom like GME, this was a one off occasion.

3: The second the plays off WSB become mainstream, we lose. Everyone and their brother wanted to get in on these “free” tendies, but with that came a lot of paper handed bitches who sold when it went down 10%, which caused exponential destruction of the stock price.

4: Finally for everyone, this is an opportunity for us to learn, and to use WSB as a tool to gain wealth. We can look as other peoples DD and do our own DD on those picks and see what we like, and WSB is overall a meme sub where people post gain and loss porn and we all are amazed at what can happen."
1612282267.0,136,We don't win if we don't BUY THE FKN DIP,"We dont need much, the majority of the work has been done. However, simply holding doesnt stop their ladder attacks. They are trading securities they already are holding themselves. If we take what is left in the market or worse, whats put in by paper hands, we reduce the pool of available shares and their ladder attacks only go so far.

What happens if everyone holds and no buying occurs? **They can drive the price down as much as they damn well feel like, causing more and more people to sell in the hysteria.** 

There are so few shares out there that could even remotely begin to cover their damn positions with (remember, they shorted over 100% of shares before this whole run up) meaning they HAVE to cover their asses eventually and the ladder attacks cannot go on as long as we BUY to REDUCE their efficacy and HOLD to force the demand upwards and reverse this momentum they are creating. 

**WE ARE NOT GUARANTEED A SHORT SQUEEZE**

We need to make that happen ourselves. Right now, we are at the precipice of the squeeze. Either it happens, by us buying whats left (NOT ON RH, OR OTHER RESTRICTED PLATFORMS) or we hold like the real retards while these rich fucks laugh their asses off and double down their short positions to do what they have inevitably been doing this whole damn time, which is making money on the way down.

What'll it be boys?

1612282257.0,58,Pleas fly again,
1612282257.0,72,Simpleton Version,"So let's put it in simple words so everyone has a clear picture of what's happening. 

The float is the number of tradable shares of a company's stock. 

1) Melvin and his chums shorted 140% of the float. Since stock is issued by the company, and short sellers have to borrow stock to conduct their business, this means they shorted 40% more than the number of shares that were ever issued. So, being greedy, they borrowed fake shares to short to really kick the company in the balls. 

2) Even after shorting 140%, Melvin still lost $6 billion give or take. Also, Melvin is owned by Citadel, who doesn't like that their baby lost. 

3) So.. Citadel turns to his other, uglier child called Robinloot (Citadel gives Robinloot 40% of their allowance), and tells him to stop letting everyone buy more shares, only sell. 

4) Citadel get's all major media outlets to report that Reddit buyers are flocking to Silver to try and divert away from GME and AMC. Luckily, we have the internet and phones and this isn't the 90's with dial up. So for some of those pricks who went to school for journalism and paid $60k to study how to write a fucking article, could just open this page and see that WSB was in fact saying they didn't buy Silver. 

5) Citadel also owns almost 0.98% of SLV ETF, is one of the largest buyers of calls and also owns large amounts of shares in more than 10 other instruments tracking silver. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR: 

Citadel is conveniently related to every single part of what's going on. 

I didn't move from a third world country to deal with this kind of bullshit and open corruption and market manipulation. What the fuck.

AOC, Biden, Elon, Chamath, Mark Cuban, Kevin O'Leary or anybody who can help, please help. This is ridiculous now.

There's also the unlimited supply of dogshit here every day now about how GME and AMC are fundamentally worth their spiked prices. Isn't this against rule 7 of the sub? GME was visibly failing and AMC was billions in debt even before the pandemic. Buy whatever the fuck you want, but WSB doesn't endorse making shit up about fundamentals you don't understand. Saying ""this isn't financial advice"" in your post means nothing. Confirmation bias at this level opens the SEC to investigate us for market manipulation.

And finally, to the new guys in our midst: if you came to this sub hoping to make money, you were fucking retarded and get the fuck out. Go to [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) or some shit. Here, making money has only ever been second to memes. What this sub has always been about is YOLO plays on worthless meme stocks, followed by loss porn and some of the best fucking memes Reddit has ever seen (obligatory shoutout to [u/haupt91](https://www.reddit.com/u/haupt91/) and the OG WSB retard gang).

1612281716.0,273,Why is the stock plummeting so much? MARK CUBAN WILL TELL YOU WHY!,"question asked by u/pinklips_indy

answered by u/mcuban : 

 ""Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand. They created a RobinHood Dive. No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers. Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.

Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls. When that margin call happens, its brutal. They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.

That then accelerates the selling.

Which then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with GME in particular

So what to do ?

If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.

Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.

I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.

I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.""

36mil in volume is not a lot! These guys shorted around $5 so unless the stock hits $5 you're fine. Even then, you're fine if we don't sell. Don't be paper handed. Most retailers are still holding.

This is a once in a lifetime chance. Red is just a color, it will change if you hold and buy the dip. I plan on buying more near end of day myself!

**The short itself will probably happen after Thursday Feb. 4th.** This is because that would be the 13th consecutive day of Failure to Deliver on a threshold security. But this only happens if the shorts can't deliver the shares they owe. They're trying to illegally drive the price down so when they buy back they can avoid a squeeze. I'm a literal retard, but I have a feeling the price is gonna start going back up on Thursday or next week. Maybe someone can explain more

**Retail investors own over 100% of the actual shares. This means the price goes as high as we want it to go. It will keep climbing until we sell. They are using every trick in the book because they know they're f*cked! This is literally free money if we all hold. There is nothing they can do but try to scare you.**

I sold my meager 40 shares like a paper handed bitch a few days ago, but have seen the error of my ways and I've been buying back in. I'm going to buy over 40 shares this time to make up for it. HOOOOOLD.

Lastly, remember to remove your stop losses so you don't sell!

For SEC interns, this is not financial advice. Idk what I'm talking about. I like the stock. Ryan Cohen is great.

**EDIT:** [More on the whole 13 consecutive days bit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/layb2c/cutting_through_fud/)

**EDIT 2:** I am speculating on when the short squeeze will happen but I'm a retard. You hold this stock even if Feb 4th comes and goes. Truthfully, it could be weeks before the squeeze happens."

1612281500.0,6,SNM Analysis & Predictions,"I felt it was time for me to gather some thoughts about ShaMaran. Sometimes it feels like you are all alone with owning this stock. And it would be nice to have some discussion about the company, and to hear other investors' views on the stock and the company. Which, in my opinion, is not necessarily the same thing. The company is doing very well, but what about the share? Nothing!! Why?

It is very difficult for me to understand that we are still at these low levels!
When the oil price has recovered to over $50 and stands at $57/brent at the time of writing. We should get up to the levels we had at the end of 2019 and start in 2020!! To begin with…

”So only there is a nice rise for the stock!”

Certainly the oil price was higher then between 60-65$ barrel. 
But then there was also uncertainty surrounding krg's payments, which were not paid between Nov-19 and Feb-20 of $41.7 million. Which we will probably soon see start being paid back. At least if we are to believe in Genel, GKP and Dana Gas who have notified the market of this.

Below I have gathered a few things that make me look bright on the future and that the stock feels interesting to own.


Refund from KGR

That we see  KRG begins repayment of the debt for delivered oil between Nov-19 and Feb-20 of 41.7 million dollars. If we get this money into the bank, it looks very good for the valuation and cash flow!

https://genelenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Genel-Resumption-of-override-payments-FINAL-11.12.20.pdf 

https://www.danagas.com/media/press-releases#sec-5986 

https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/gulf_keystone_petroleum/news/rns/story/w6qe47r  

Why doesn't SNM do the same? And why don't they answer the question of refunds and give feedback to the market when I ask them? Is this in Taqa or what is it that is taking so long? Here I see the closest trigger for the stock! So it's very frustrating that they don't communicate this course-driven information to the market! 

I think they can be much better at communicating to the market, what the stock needs are new buyers and higher turnover to attract interest from larger investors. Which is an absolute prerequisite for an higher valuation of the company. Here, the company management needs to become much more active in its actions regarding marketing the company. Why don't they do more to be seen?






Increase in Company Gross 2P Reserves

We should expect an update before February is over. There can certainly be positive surprises here. What is interesting is our reserves in relation to our production and what has been communicated around development plans for the field. I can't make up the math here. www.shamaranpetroleum.com/site/assets/files/5222/corporate_presentation_-_dec_2020.pdfPage 2 108.5 million barrels 2P/C It produces today according to page 4. An average of 46,300 barrels per day with an ambition to raise these significantly. To 80 000-100 000 a day!108 500 000 / 46300 = 2344 / 365 = 6.5 So in about 6.5 years, you're out of oil? No, I don't think so. More oil will be transferred to 2P/C but the question is how much and when it will happen? 

How much oil is there in Atrush? I believe in a lot of oil...



KRG and Baghdad
Will we finally see a solution between KRG and Baghdad on the budget? And what will it mean for IOCs operating in KRG if SOMO receives 250 bpd, will Baghdad see the contracts as legal? And how will investors view the companies operating in Kurdistan? Does some of the risk disappear? And the companies get a completely different valuation?

www.forbes.com/sites/debtwire/2021/01/04/iraqi-and-kurdistan-budget-hangs-in-the-balance/amp/  


Sarsang and Total

Very exciting things are happening in the neighboring block, Sarsang, where Total is possibly on its way to sell its share of 18%. According to Bloomberg, Total believes it can get up to $ 500 million for its part. And if they get close to that price, that would be very positive, for the valuation of nearby Atrush! And who could be the buyer? I think that the Russian companies in particular is strengthening its presence in the area. But time will tell. 

www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-04/total-said-to-be-in-talks-to-sell-stake-in-kurdistan-oil-field   


Plan for expansion

It will be very interesting to see if there are any decisions, about expanding the field to 80-100bopd. This was to be decided on, in 2020 but was put on hold when Covid-19 became a fact and the oil price crashed. But now it's time I think to make a decision on the issue regarding the future expansion of the field. 

Page 3. www.shamaranpetroleum.com/site/assets/files/5158/2019-12-snm-cp.pdf 

Here I see the greatest potential for an upgrade of the company. Here, future company value and future belief regarding Atrush's ability to be the company's basis for stability and sole asset are determined. I would like to see the use of cash flow to acquire new assets. And that the company can grow further with higher share prices as a result! 





”Installation of Second Trainat Early Production Facility""

I think it is very interesting to look back at information that the company has given before. To create an image of where they are today or in the near future. If you look at the presentation from August. 

Page 8 www.shamaranpetroleum.com/site/assets/files/5196/corporate_presentation-shamaran-rev10.pdf 

So it will be very interesting regarding the opportunity to see an increase of production in the very near future. Wonder how far the company has come?

”Installation of Second Trainat Early Production Facility. Second productiontrain (EPF.T2) brings current Atrush processing capacity in line with well capacity circa 58Mbopd.” 

Is it already installed and they can easily screw up prod 10,000 barrels / day? There is a lot that justifies this, among other things, if you get the debt back from Nov-Feb faster. That calculation becomes much more appealing if you count on 55$ barrels/brent, which we are a bit over now at the time of writing, and a production of 58,000 barrels / day. I do not see it as completely unlikely that in the foreseeable future we will hear from the company that they will increase production to these levels. This is, after all, information from August and it is quite reasonable that we are there today.


Conditions for earning. As everyone knows, the price of oil is very important. And here I think we will see a surprisingly large re-inhibition of the prize in 2021. What happens to the oil price is always uncertain as it can change overnight both up and down. But there is much to suggest a strong recovery in demand. And this, at the same time as investment in the sector has been declining for several years. This could be a perfect storm for oil prices if supply cannot meet demand. Shamaran produces at a very low cost and here there is an incredible leverage with a higher oil price.
www.macrovoices.com/guest-content/list-guest-publications/4009-art-berman-macrovoices-jan-7-2021/file
And for every dollar that the oil price increases by, the higher the earnings for snm. Here I think the market will change attitudes towards oil stocks overall in line with a higher oil price.

&#x200B;

1. Figure out how much you are willing to trade. Treat the money you are willing to trade as lost money. This way you know your max loss and if you are willing to accept that loss, then you can diamond hand any red day.

&#x200B;

2. Don’t trade on margin. One of my best friends bought AMD at $2 and still lost it all because he went on margin and was forced to liquidate. Brokerages can and will manually liquidate your positions to cover their asses. Bottom line, don’t do it. 

&#x200B;

3. Have an exit strategy. Let’s be honest here, the distance to the moon, Pluto, and Andromeda are finite, same goes for GME. You don’t have to admit it to anyone on WSB, but you should always have a number that when reached, you are willing to exit.

&#x200B;

4. Don’t get greedy. The saying that pigs get fat hogs get slaughtered is very true. Ask any 🐻 who held on past 4/1/2020 to show you their account and you will see. Again, you don’t have to admit it here, but know it in your heart.

&#x200B;

5. Be fluid. Market condition changes, that goes both ways. Assuming you are following the above rules, there may be days where you will buy the dip. To the contrary, there may be days when you profit take. 

&#x200B;

6. Don’t be a sheep. Let’s be honest with ourselves for a moment. Not all hedge funds are betting against GME. There are hedge funds betting on GME. Moreover, there are people who are trying to profit from directional movement in either direction and are spreading lies on WSB to enrich themselves. Don’t be a sheep and blindly follow others.

&#x200B;

7. Be on the look out for the next 10 bagger. I assume that almost no one here wants GME to be their last trade. I’m not saying you should sell your positions, what I’m saying is always be on the lookout for the next big thing while you hold on to your position. It would be the same thing as you getting into GME when it was $5.

&#x200B;

8. Don’t let GME break you. Trading takes a toll no matter if you are up or down. Don’t let one trade crush you. Remember, you are trading to get rich so you can better yourself, not trading to become a slave.

&#x200B;

\*I have never purchased or sold short,  nor do I intend to purchase or sell short any GME equities or derivatives. Having said that, I wish my WSB brothers best of luck."

Stay strong my $GME brethren. If this drops down to $35.50ish like i expect it to I will be adding to this position. I love the company and products, Historic earnings coming soon. Wish i would have entered after the predictable ipo drop but this wasn't on my radar lol Oh well. Wish you all the best.

Take it easy,
Take it slow.
Sell when it's high,
After buying when it's low.

Emotion is dangerous,
Leave it out of the game.
Become a true robot,
And you'll always trade the same.

Hold with both hands,
Hold it till you're right.
And if it doesn't listen,
Cut your loss without spite.

Find value in the symbol,
And play what's in play.
The secret to profits,
Is to do this every day.

Common sense is gifted,
Use it to its fullest.
Don't overthink stuff,
Are you bearish or bullish.

Manage risk at all costs,
Small losses and big wins.
The house controls the market,
But you pull your own strings.

So get on going now,
And focus as a pro.
Discipline and patience,
Will make your portfolio grow.

Use it to your advantage, one day you might be sailing the sea of tendies on the SS Diamond Hands."

Now you got the mod team stickying comments for gambling/help hotlines and that’s when you know how bad and truly fucked people are from these last two weeks.

1612281131.0,508,"They're dumping shares onto the market, CONTINUE TO HOLD🚀🚀","While looking at the bids and asks on Gamestop I noticed that at the start a lot of ask's with a lot of shares were placed, those are probably by institutional investors. My theory is that they were dumping a lot of stocks onto the market to make it seem like the stock is plummeting. Just look at this bid with 30k shares:

&#x200B;

[a lot of ask's with a \(relatively\) big volume at once ](https://preview.redd.it/8rrkvhr133f61.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=21f0ed5ea7661f596f47ec077aaa851114c46611)

The good news is that it seems like they can't keep up with the volume since most of us are holding the stock, and because most retail investors already bought GME, it seems like the demand is going down.

&#x200B;

[Here you can clearly see that the volume of stocks being dumped on the market is going down.](https://preview.redd.it/16dezk0l33f61.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=a070b8551318b19742b7514028b569e50eeb5a4d)

So what does that mean for us? As long as we're not able to match the dumping of shares onto the market with enough demand the price will probably continue to go down, but that doesn't matter as long as we keep holding with our FUCKING DIAMOND HANDS 💎🤲!!
