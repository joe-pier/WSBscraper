# WSBscraper
Reddit Scraper

Work in progress...

Soon a website to visualize the data and possibly a good NLP algorithm!

TO USE THE SCRIPT PLEASE FILL IN ONLY WITH YOUR USERNAME

Running the script you will scrape the WSB subreddit and retrive the data shown in the REDDIT.csv file. 
The data are analyzed through some functions, which can output a .csv file visible in the exemples folder, 
if the tocsv parameter is set to True.

the most interesting function for now is top_used_words which has various parameters that 
allow you to create some possible views of the most used words on the WSB subreddit.
