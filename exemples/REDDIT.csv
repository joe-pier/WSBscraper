Greetings and salutations strangers of the inter-webs.

Like most people with ARK heavy portfolios, Ive been taking a beating these last 2 months. Debating on whether or not to wait it out (which Im willing to do) or if its a better idea to shift some things around. So of course Im looking for the opinions of random people on a stock sub-reddit for highly valuable feedback.

1619026175.0,3,"CLOV the possibility of a Gamma Squeeze! We are here to make money, so stop the hate.","Hi, apes

&#x200B;

So since the wrong SI% of float report came out, lots and lots of calls have been bought. Just to mention it, the SI% of the float is still very high, around 39% according to S3Partners. This now leads us to a very interesting case, a Gamma squeeze. Be aware to reach a Gamma squeeze the stock price first needs to go up to where these enormous amounts of calls are. A catalyst could trigger a surge in the stock price, leading to a huge amount of calls being ITM, forcing naked call sellers to buy back shares.

**What is a gamma squeeze?**

""The **gamma squeeze** happens when the underlying stock's price begins to go up very quickly within a short period of time. As more money flows into call options from investors, that forces more buying activity which can lead to higher stock prices""

&#x200B;

Down below is a picture of the option chain of CLOV:

There are 304657 calls OTM up to strike $30. This is over 30m shares to be executed if the price goes above $30 on May 21st. In other words, this is around 28% of the entire public float. This reminds me a lot of the good old days on GME were lots and lots of calls were bought, and then the thing exploded and all calls ended ITM creating a gamma squeeze! The same could happen on CLOV if the price goes high enough.

&#x200B;

The thing is, with this many calls and such a high SI% of float shorties would have trouble covering their short positions. 40m+ shares are sold short. 30m+ shares would be ITM if the stock price goes above $30. The public float is only 109m shares. The largest shareholder is Vanguard with 26m shares, which brings the float down to 83m shares!

Sorry for the short DD, but I haven't seen a DD on here explaining this scenario

Position: 116x $10 calls expiring May 21st.

And just for the sake of it, this is not financial advice"
1619025874.0,2,Why I am shorting GoPro (GPRO),"Let me start off by saying I am a huge fan of GoPro and have been since the release of the GoPro Hero 2. 

But although I like the product and the GoPro Hero 9 is my current go-to action camera, the stock price far overvalues the company. The stock saw around a 520% increase to the peak of recent prices from last March. What justified this increase in price? 

GoProâ€™s recent turn to selling subscriptions and their high 2020 subscriber counts was the good news for investors. They had a total of 760,000 subscribers by the end of 2020,  a 145% increase in subscriptions from the previous year.  Those who follow this company closely know that this increase in subscription price was due to the release of the GoPro Hero 9 and the promotion of $200 off a bundle package with the purchase of a GoPro subscription. Users know that the grammar of the subscription details was very sketchy and it was unclear if users could immediately cancel their subscription after purchase without being charged the $200 they saved because they didnâ€™t hold their subscription for a whole year. Their subscription numbers hold just based on their GoPro Hero 9 release, few GoPro users turn to GoPro for accessories. Most GoPro users will go online where they can purchase an accessory mount from a different brand for more than 70% cheaper. GoProâ€™s strength in versatility has always relied on third party gear for custom mounts and specialized attachments. GoPro users who are looking to mod out their GoPro with a mic, ND filters, or stands, turn to companies such as Rode, Polar Pro, or other companies that are cheaper and higher quality than the modifications GoPro provides.

The company also turned to its Quik app to attract anyone who does video and photo editing/storing, not just GoPro users. GoPro has always been releasing apps but the apps themselves were finicky and never worth using from my experience. It will definitely be interesting to see the report on the success of the app when the company reports its earnings on May 6th.

As a GoPro user, as much as I like the company, I see that the product line is stagnant. GoPro releases one new camera a year (plus the MAX) and itâ€™s users can barely justify the upgrade due to minimal change between models. Many youtubers and influencers commonly tell consumers to wait for the next model to upgrade since differences arenâ€™t very significant. GoProâ€™s latest release was a pair of floating black sunglasses. They have tried multiple times in the past to get into lifestyle gear and it never caught on with their consumer base but they continue to release lifestyle gear, an indicator of how little the company is focusing on change. The moat of GoPro used to be HUGE but now, every other company has an action camera that is cheaper, similar in design, and often does more than what the GoPro offers (DJI, InstaOne, Garmin). 

The company is stuck on its GoPro Hero line and for the most part it is trapped. It tried to expand into making drones but DJI snuffed them out quick. It relies too much on third parties to provide accessories for the users that their accessories donâ€™t make them enough revenue. Their software apps have always been substandard. GoPro is not a long term hold and I would argue they are not a short term one either. Earnings report on May 6th!"
1619024523.0,1,(AHCO) analysis mid cap stock that massively undervalued,"Hello Reddit I would like to post an analysis on (AHCO) this company came across my screener last Friday where I then wrote a report in slid show format (easy for work). I am rather bullish on the stock and I get bore bullish on it by the day. I should mention though i dod not put it in my report, the premiums for call contracts are insanely low, I have ran the numbers for me if it his the levels it was trading at call contracts could see 600-700% returns, consivertivly i peg the returns at 50-100%, but its a matter of how one holds. (when trading on anything I say it is your discretion and risk, it is not my responsibility if you loose money on this trade should you put money on it)  


Also forgive any poor spelling, I havent been sleeping well and I have been drinking (work relates stress). But I hope at least a few of you enjoy
