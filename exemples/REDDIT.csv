1619065096.0,10,SPCE Why I Think We Fly in May! Smol DD,"Fellow Apes and Space Monkees,

I have seen the FUD and 🌈🐻 Chads on the Roam.

Ignore all that fuzz and dig this DD.

None of the Fundamentals have changed since February and that the biggest thing.

I honestly believe they will continue on with the S2 Flight Schedule and head for the Moon.

Here are a few simple reasons

1. They want to begin sales in 2022 and the S3 won't be ready by then, the S3 really only has minor improvements anyways. One of them being turn around time. I personally think the S3 is not nearly as ready as people think it is ( hence the CGI interior, which may be why LAND ROVER is partnering with them for some Dope Comfy Interior's ), and it still needs a lot of work.
2. They already invested a ton of money into a working S2 Ship/Plane, they are going to want tomake their money back on that. They may even use both the S2 and S3 next year to maximizethe amount of Flights they can do. Building these planes isn't fast and each individual planeneeds rigorous testing.

They have put a ton of work into the S2 and the S3 has been around for awhile now they didn't build it over night. If they planned on canceling this May flight they wouldn't have said anything about flying at all. They aren't stupid even if we don't respect/like their decisions.

Could they use a better PR department and someone to handle their Social Media? Yes!

They just announced a partnership with Land Rover. ( Which I think isn't getting enough attention )

SpaceX would do the same thing, they would use their working models while they test on newer models and rotate them out when they are no longer efficient to use.

This is not financial advice I am a low tier tard with big dreams and smol memes.

1619064188.0,10,Why $PTON is going to bounce back hard,"With current events of negative light coming to Peloton due to operator negligence, their stocks have dropped significantly. I want to remind everyone why their stocks will not only soar back up to the $150 mark, but why it'll go even further than that. 

First off, as the pandemic hit and caused everyone to be forced to stay at home, the desire for residential fitness equipment skyrocketed. Even till today, residential and commercial customers are still having a hard time getting their hands on new dumbbells and strength equipment. Peloton monopolized hard on this pandemic not only by selling a shit ton of residential equipment such as spin bikes and treadmills, but by also requiring a pretty hefty subscription based service to use them. Something around $39 a month. 

Second off, during late last year they made the financial decision to buy out a MAJOR fitness company that has been making commercial treadmills, ellipticals, upright and recumbent bikes, and several different strength equipment for 40 years. Peloton bought out Precor, along with all of their factories. Gyms will still be buying Precor simply for the name. Most gyms once they have a brand they like, keep buying that same brand for everything. Precor will still be a heavily demanded product. 

Peloton now has their hands dipped into a massive chunk of the fitness market, both residential and commercial. And with their residential side also pulling in all those subscription based fees, they aren't short for money anywhere. 

As for the recent accidents involving Peloton treadmills, all treadmills are dangerous and can kill you. This isn't something unique to Peloton. I don't care if they have roller guards on them or not, there is not one single treadmill out there that will protect you, a child, a pet, or any item from being sucked underneath the belt. 

If you want to prevent unnessary injury or death, remove your safety key from the treadmill when not in use if you live with children. Fitness equipment are not toys. 

Peloton will bounce back from this, and when they do, they will still be neck deep in both the residential and the commercial markets."

1619062128.0,13,$XM Qualtrics SMASHES forecasts today - Up 14% after market,"So much of what gets posted here is some stock with incredible growth potential and very little real value, like a bet on the roulette table on 35 black. 

Qualtrics is definitely NOT that type of company. So what do they do? They operate in a new SaaS (software as a service) category that uses AI and deep learning to bridge the experiences between business, employees, consumers and products. It’s a cloud platform that helps businesses grow, engage employees in a positive work culture, customers spend more and companies develop better products. Right? BORING.

Here’s what you need to know: they IPOd last year and are severely undervalued. Over 13,500 companies and organizations use XM, including more than 75% of the Fortune 100 companies. Q1 subscription revenue is up to $186M, up 46% YoY. And forward guidance is super juicy. Remaining performance obligations total $1.1B, which is up 77% YoY. If you don’t already know, performance obligations are contractual agreements to delivery services for revenue, a peek into future earnings. Fair value is $154.71 according to DCF modelling.

And BTW don’t confuse this ticker with Sirius XM Holdings LOLLLL

This is not financial advice. I’m not an advisor. I do have a long position in the company.

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811414/000156459020042442/kcac-ex103\_63.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811414/000156459020042442/kcac-ex103_63.htm)

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811414/000119312520326213/d53940ds1a.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811414/000119312520326213/d53940ds1a.htm)

The lock-up period for QS New holders (but not officers/directors) expires April 24th and the first market day after is Monday, April 26th.

The last lock up Expiration of the PIPE shares on Jan 4th led to a slide from $84.45 to $49.96 (\~40%)

In addition, QS has the Scorpion capital short report going against them.

It appears pretty damning overall, not that QS is a scam as Scorpion claims but that QS is certainly hiding issues with the technology (dendrite formation, the thickness of membrane, failing to disclose Columbus ratio, etc).

I don't want to go into personal feelings on shorts, but as a biochemist and student of battery tech; the complaints certainly have some merit.  
On the other hand, a company working on battery tech with BILLIONS of $ in potential earnings would certainly be secretive about some things, especially new solutions to old and expensive problems.

Market Cap 12.763B with no sellable product and their own timetable (heavily challenged by experts) is a claimed 4 years with experts weighing in at 8 years min and 10-12 likely.

History:  
Up 9% today  
Down 17% over 5 days  
Down 43% over 30 days  
Up 136% over 6M  
Up 239% over 1Y

Down 60% YTD

I purchased some puts (they are not cheap due to IV) 5/21 33p with plans to unload late next week as lock-up Expiry crashes the price. They were a slight discount today IMO due to the stock being up 9%.

I am not overly interested in the long-term prospects and my doesn't really consider the long-term technology value, just the lock expiry and the recent short report as well.

If the holders are 100% confident,, it wont go well.

If the current employees feel anything close to previous employees/Scorpion capital, it will pay quite nicely.

A 40% drop would put it at \~20$ and a 33p would print at over $900 profit (intrinsic+ value - premium).   


Probably unrealistic due to the deep-pocketed backers but even a 10% drop would put it at 29.70.   


Current prices o options are pricey due to IV and my breakeven is $28.59 on 5/21 (but I plan on dumping next week.

1619034220.0,8,Bayer turnaround of a hammered Stonk,Bayer the company that got hammered down to losing 2/3 rds of its valuation by buying the globally very beloved firm Monsanto is at an attractive buying point in my opinion. They settled most of the glyphosate cases now and are working on a solution for future cases. There will be a judge’s decision revealed on 12 th May. If the judge acknowledges the two billion additional payment on top of the 10 billion they already spent for the settlements. This stock will rally back because it trades lower than at times when analysts estimated costs up to 40 billion dollars. In reality it is much cheaper now. And here comes the next catalyst: Bayer produces the Curevac vaccines. So this will be Bayer/Curevac. Also they are in genomics and bought a lot of crispr tech companies. These companies alone could get a higher valuation alone if listed than the whole big giant Bayer is trading right now. I’m bullish and confident the company will manage a turnaround story.

VIAC generates 40% of it's revenue from advertising, 31% is subscription (or affiliate) fees, and 23% is from licensing content.

VIAC is transforming their business into a streaming giant, with PlutoTV (43 million monthly active users) and Paramount+ (launched in March this year, 30 million CBS AllAccess subscribers were moved to Paramount+). VIAC acquired PlutoTV 2 years ago for 340 million (now worth billions already).

next earnings is on May 6 (first time Paramount+ user growth will be reported).

&#x200B;

VIAC is back to pre-COVID price levels after it announced a $3bn equity raise for content production end of March and after millions of shares got dumped on the open market after Archegos  blew up.

[A: NFLX, B: VIAC](https://preview.redd.it/jjv6xuzvlku61.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=251a483a42aa4460ca81b0622c6591d5e3d6aa54)

VIAC annual revenue was $25.29bn (NFLX was $25bn), while VIAC net income was $2.31bn (NFLX was $2.67bn).

VIAC trades at 24.9bn market cap while NFLX trades at 244.6bn (that's correct, 10x more). NFLX posted pretty disappointing earnings yesterday, also mentioning slower user growth for 2021.

VIAC owns Paramount, a  film production company that produces titles like Titanic, Mission Impossible, The Godfather, Star Trek, Top Gun, Spongebob, Transformers, you name it.

Paramount owns distribution rights for even more titles, including all recent Marvel universe movies (all Iron Mans, Thor, Avengers, Captain America, etc), Southpark, etc.

1619032351.0,34,Blackberry covered calls warning...be careful,"Be careful with writing covered calls for blackberry. They(institutions and shorts) want you to write these covered call. Total short on stock is about 60 million or 10% of all shares. They realized that blackberry has a monopoly in connected and EV car operating system with Blackberry QNX and IVY, and they also have monopoly in Cybersecurity with Blackberry Spark for protecting critical iot devices (government computers and phones, drones, trafficlight, meter, all smart city infrastructure). This is a very critical monopoly that Blackberry will not admit to yet because Congress will then break them up. 

&#x200B;

Why monopoly in cybersecurity for IOT?  
If you look at all hacking that happened since December on government and enterprise(30,000 companies), none using Blackberry Spark were impacted!!! After Department of Commerce was hacked they immediately switched to Blackberry Spark. Same with Airforce and Canadian Government.  Crowdstrike will be a joke in coming years. Only blackberry has a zero trust architecture out of all cybersecurity company, and that's why they are able to protect governments from hacks like Solarwind and others can't do it. 

&#x200B;

Why monopoly in Car EV and Connected Cars?  
The Blackberry QNX software is THE ONLY car operating system authorized for connected cars. This is why every car company is signed up with Blackberry. Even Tesla's component coming from NVDIA uses Blackberry. The NVDIA controller used by Tesla for their autonomous driving is running on QNX. QNX is inherntly the most secure operating system in the world!!! The proof is in contracts from every car company to blackberry. The Rev will be about $50 per car in coming years. The Blackberry IVY will add about $10-$20 recurring revenue per car per year in coming years. 

&#x200B;

So why not write covered calls?  
The institution and hedge funds and shorts will trigger them soon. The Patent sale will be minimum of $15 billion for 25,000 patents. Patent is bread and butter of any company. Chen said ""most patents' that's why i'm thinking he's selling more than 20k patents. $15Billion automatically takes the price to $40!!!!!! overnight!!! you will lose your shares to hedge funds that're short and institutions."

The study was recently changed to a ""crossover"" study, in which the people who received placebo in the first 2 shots will now be given the real shot, and vice versa.  I received my 3rd shot today. This effectively eliminates the placebo group, I have not been ""unblinded"" but all placebo group participants are getting shots, and the effectiveness of placebo/vaccine going forward can not be determined directly. This means that they must already have the data needed to obtain FDA emergency authorization. 

The time from Phase III start to authorization is now the same amount of months as  Moderna, Pfizer, and J&J took (about 4 months). 

Based on this, I believe the Novavax vaccine will obtain FDA emergency approval within the next 2-3 weeks. The stock can be expected to rise a moderate amount when this news occurs.

1619025874.0,62,Why I am shorting GoPro (GPRO),"Let me start off by saying I am a huge fan of GoPro and have been since the release of the GoPro Hero 2. 

But although I like the product and the GoPro Hero 9 is my current go-to action camera, the stock price far overvalues the company. The stock saw around a 520% increase to the peak of recent prices from last March. What justified this increase in price? 

GoPro’s recent turn to selling subscriptions and their high 2020 subscriber counts was the good news for investors. They had a total of 760,000 subscribers by the end of 2020,  a 145% increase in subscriptions from the previous year.  Those who follow this company closely know that this increase in subscription price was due to the release of the GoPro Hero 9 and the promotion of $200 off a bundle package with the purchase of a GoPro subscription. Users know that the grammar of the subscription details was very sketchy and it was unclear if users could immediately cancel their subscription after purchase without being charged the $200 they saved because they didn’t hold their subscription for a whole year. Their subscription numbers hold just based on their GoPro Hero 9 release, few GoPro users turn to GoPro for accessories. Most GoPro users will go online where they can purchase an accessory mount from a different brand for more than 70% cheaper. GoPro’s strength in versatility has always relied on third party gear for custom mounts and specialized attachments. GoPro users who are looking to mod out their GoPro with a mic, ND filters, or stands, turn to companies such as Rode, Polar Pro, or other companies that are cheaper and higher quality than the modifications GoPro provides.

The company also turned to its Quik app to attract anyone who does video and photo editing/storing, not just GoPro users. GoPro has always been releasing apps but the apps themselves were finicky and never worth using from my experience. It will definitely be interesting to see the report on the success of the app when the company reports its earnings on May 6th.

As a GoPro user, as much as I like the company, I see that the product line is stagnant. GoPro releases one new camera a year (plus the MAX) and it’s users can barely justify the upgrade due to minimal change between models. Many youtubers and influencers commonly tell consumers to wait for the next model to upgrade since differences aren’t very significant. GoPro’s latest release was a pair of floating black sunglasses. They have tried multiple times in the past to get into lifestyle gear and it never caught on with their consumer base but they continue to release lifestyle gear, an indicator of how little the company is focusing on change. The moat of GoPro used to be HUGE but now, every other company has an action camera that is cheaper, similar in design, and often does more than what the GoPro offers (DJI, InstaOne, Garmin). 

The company is stuck on its GoPro Hero line and for the most part it is trapped. It tried to expand into making drones but DJI snuffed them out quick. It relies too much on third parties to provide accessories for the users that their accessories don’t make them enough revenue. Their software apps have always been substandard. GoPro is not a long term hold and I would argue they are not a short term one either. Earnings report on May 6th!"

I am rather bullish on the stock and I get bore bullish on it by the day. I should mention though i dod not put it in my report, the premiums for call contracts are insanely low, I have ran the numbers for me if it his the levels it was trading at call contracts could see 600-700% returns, consivertivly i peg the returns at 50-100%, but its a matter of how one holds.

Let’s just say it’s 2 billion for now + 800 million 2.8 billion

4.6 minus 2.8 billion cash on hand = 1.8 billion

They are giving blackberry the WHOLE company, with 68% ev market, spark security, Amazon partnership with ivy, qnx in 175 million vehicles, 700 - 900 million revenue per year a valuation of 1.8 billion

Let me say it again, the whole company for only 1.8 billion valuation (some people here say 3 billion when factoring in debt, either way it’s low)

After the covid crash last year BB market cap hit 1.7 billion, so after including potential cash on hand BB is trading at the same market cap today right now as it was at the bottom of covid crash


Edit: people in here talking about debt, blackberry has always had debt and is an ongoing part of their valuation, it doesn’t change the fact of what the valuation was 12 months ago to what it is now when you include the patent sale, they have less debt now than they use to and they are also going to have more cash than they use to. The market cap is still extremely low valuation to give the company after you factor in the cash they will have soon. From what I was able to find it seems debt was only 459 million in November

1618982793.0,124,"Nintendo - underrated Value? (sorry for bad English, I'm from Germany)","In this post, I want to discuss the hidden values of Nintendo.

1. We start with a short fundamental analysis

\-Nintendo has liabilities of round about 32,5$ per share

\-on the other hand there are 119,5$ equity

that means we have 87$ assets per share (we can subtract this amount for the further analysis, because this value is available in assets)

one share cost round about 580$ - 87$(in assets) we get a price of 493$

If we use the predicted earnings for next year, we've got a PE-ratio of 15,5.

That's a normal PE-ratio for a Japanese Share, but what are the hidden values of Nintendo (in my opinion)?

As many of us, I was watching YouTube Videos in the Corona-Time. And I got addicted to Pokemon Booster openings. In this context I realized, that my generation, has a big emotional bond to Nintendo products. Nintendo still hold's the license for popular franchises like Pokemon and Mario Kart. The amounts of money, that flew, just for very old products of this franchise, give u a roughly estimate, of how big, the value actually is.

Pls use the commentary function to change my mind :)"

I am faithful because blackberry is the underdog that wall street has casted aside (and given the fact that a loss is only a loss if you sale!) and berated BB as a profitless tech co. and has soured their legitimacy. It is deeply undervalued for reasons unbeknownst to anyone.

It is leading the tech industry in 5G in South [Asia](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/blackberry-will-power-baidu-technology-for-future-chinese-evs/); BB has partnerships with tech giants like Baidu--- securing a contract to run Baidu's mapping tech on their infrastructure for autonomous vehicles -- a partnership that will pay dividends as that market is only projected to grow in the future. I ask again why do Boomers hate BB? I don't fucking know.

Not to mention, BB has a very respected and competent CEO who in my opinion is being [overpaid](https://financialpost.com/investing/blackberry-ceo-chen-gets-128-million-award-to-continue-revival), but has the potential to bring the stock to 30.00 by the end of this year.  He has a proven track [record](https://www.canadianbusiness.com/leadership/blackberry-ceo-john-chen-turnaround-interview/).

oh, and by the way, BB is not a fucking smart phone company. At least not anymore. Maybe this is why they are not respected? That's a bullshit cop out; there's real money to be made with BB if we give it the proper evaluation. This [ape](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l0ujm0/is_blackberry_bb_actually_undervalued/) was absolutely correct.  BB is a tech co. that develops secured communication systems, cyber security infrastructure, and works to secure these systems through AI.    It is deeply undervalued and is a underdog.

**Lets give BB a hand.**

1618963907.0,69,$VIAC Bananas 🍌🍌🍌,"**TL;DR**. 

*Even in a declining environment VIAC is still fairly valued at* **$37.83.**  
*And in a bullish environment VIAC is fairly valued at* **$65.26.**.   
*And based on the EPV valuation it is a woapping* **$86.23**   

**VIAC offers a unique opportunity to take advantage of a current market in-efficiency.**   
As we all know by now a series of events lead to Archegos getting margin called. The Archegos fund was extremely aggressive and was operating under 5x leverage, heavily concentrating on Chinese and Media Stocks, such as BAIDU, BILI, TCEHY, IQ, VIAC, DISCA. There are many articles that explain how this margin call came to be. I won’t be discussing it here, because I want to discuss the opportunity this presents.

Whether you think Paramount + is good or not. I still think there is still an opportunity to cash in on VIAC’s assets. VIAC has a strong balance sheet and many assets that are valuable in the content business regardless if Paramount + takes off or not. Let’s address the elephants in the room. Can Paramount + compete with the top players like NFLX, DIS, or even HBO MAX?
I don’t think it matters if they can successfully compete or not because they have a huge library of content they can sell licences on and this makes them a valuable target to be acquired by the likes of AAPL or AMZN who are trying to pave their way into the streaming business. Their main revenue driver is cable television and everybody is cutting the cord these days so this is a shrinking segment, this does pose a risk to their recurring revenue. However they have another valuable asset that will help them offset this risk, and that is live sports. Although cable TV is shrinking, sports is definitely not and VIAC has many contracts and rights to stream live sports on their Paramount + service. None of the top 3 streaming services I mentioned does live sports streaming, and I’m sure they would love to add live sports on their library of contents. Their only competitor in the live sports segment FUBO. I do not perceive FUBO as a threat yet as they’re extremely overvalued and the business is losing money and has a lot of catching up to do. Even if FUBO is acquired before VIAC does, the acquisition of FUBO will force the other large streaming service to try and acquire their own to compete.

**The Valuation:**

I will present you with 3 different valuation all of them assume Paramount + is a flop and does not take off so I assume zero growth on their streaming service.   

Scenario one: Bullcase, I assume they will grow their total revenue by 3-5% for the next 5 year.  
[Revenue Estimates](https://imgur.com/78x276u).  
[DCF Valuation](https://imgur.com/s6TOmhj)

Scenario two: Bearcase, I assume their total revenue will be shrinking by  (-) 7-3%.  
[Revenue Calculations](https://imgur.com/JUWIXuz).  
[DCF Valuation](https://imgur.com/gra7R5E).  

Scenario three: I used an old school valuation method to value the business, Earning Power Value (EPV). In the EPV method it takes away the requirement for trying to predict the future and only takes into account the present business earning power. This method of valuation assumes no growth to the business. This method of valuation is a good valuation metric for valuing mature non growing businesses.

**Conclusion:**

Even in a declining environment VIAC is still fairly valued at **$37.83**.  
And in a bullish environment VIAC is fairly valued at **$65.26**.  
And based on the EPV valuation it is a woapping **$86.23**. 

This is not financial advice. I'm an ape"
1618963804.0,15,NVAX - Likely my last update DD before reaching Callhalla,"I've made a few posts before this ( [1st Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq3ksw/nvax_dont_miss_this_perfect_vaccine_play_headed/),  [2nd Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/luuige/nvax_part_ii_last_call_before_a_shit_ton_of/), [3rd Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mlielu/nvax_i_liked_it_at_300_i_love_it_at_180/)) but I know it's alot to go through so I shall give a brief comprehensive summary here. Just a reminder none of this is financial advice, I am but a mere PhD student that has had the ride of their lives on this stock. My goal isn't to shill or hype but instead to sharpen the conviction of my fellow big-cojone'd NVAX bulls, to concentrate info from different sources, and to create a space for discussion and overleveraged speculation. I think this stock is done taking a shit, we have a good idea of lower bound supports, and we're ready to blow some loads with upcoming catalysts. I also have some current questions I'd like to get the input of the community on. So let's dig in!

**1) Why I believe in the technology**

Really recommend my first post for a more in-depth discussion on this but basically this vaccine is antigen-based which is a very standard tried-and-true modality often used in ""traditional"" vaccines like flu vaccines etc. What makes them special is they add a natural compound (an ""adjuvant"") that makes your immune system super responsive to the antigen. This adjuvant is actually a saponin that is harvested from soapbark trees that grow in Chile. The benefit of using this is that 1) old people and people with weak immune systems respond well and build immunity even with lower doses of antigen 2) you can make vaccines with small amounts of antigen which makes them much cheaper and MOST IMPORTANTLY 3) you can ""fit"" more antigen varieties into a single dose. There's only so much antigen you can inject into a person at once so with this technology you can have a single vaccine with flu AND several covid variant antigens as opposed to having to get a separate vaccine for each virus. Also since this vaccine is protein antigen based you can keep it at 4C (same temp you keep your beers) for months.

Additionally!!!!! We've seen alot of AMAZING efficacy and safety results from the UK and SA phase 1/2/3 trials and the US phase 1/2 trial (still waiting for phase 3 data to drop soon!). **This is one of the main reasons I remain so bullish.** The humongous unknown risk of efficacy/safety has been largely cleared and now we're just sifting through some other issues/bottlenecks/FUD that I will talk about below. Anyone that trades biotech stocks knows that safety/efficacy are the BIGGEST risk that can curb stomp a stock and we've cleared that in my opinion.

&#x200B;

**2) A brief history of this chart**

This is one of the wildest charts you'll find and I think it's incredibly important to understand what caused it to look like that so that you can get a better picture of where we're going.

**Sept 2016** \- Plummet from \~$150 to \~$25 came from their RSV vaccine getting poor efficacy results

**Feb 2019** \- Plummet from \~$40 to \~$10 came from them failing the RSV efficacy trials again lmao. HOWEVER things are looking up for RSV vaccine recently (this deserves its own DD honestly but you can read more about it [here](https://www.novavax.com/our-pipeline))

At this point you can see why investors had no faith in NVAX. It was beaten down like a rabid dog like Ziptrader Charlie would say. Enter covid left stage:

**May 2020** \- Gap up from \~$15 to \~$40 came from A) fantastic nano-Flu phase 3 results (their very own flu vaccine, shown to be better than the current state-of-the-art flu vaccines) which is basically their first big WIN and B) beginning of clinical trials for covid vaccine.

**Aug 2020** \- Gap up to $180 came from great phase 1/2 covid vaccine results! I remember these glory days. Too bad we then plummeted and became range bound in the $80-$100 range. This was caused by a combo of sell-the-news and competitor companies (MRNA, BNTX, JNJ, AZN) making fast progress.

**Feb 2021**  \- Gap up to $300 from phase 3 interim data coming from UK phase 3 trial. This was fantastic news! Best in class vaccine with stellar safety and 96% efficacy against original variant. 

**Mar 2021 - Present** \- We fell from grace and have been bouncing between $170 and $220. Lots of factors here but of course the March market madness did not help this low float stock. I vividly remember NVAX falling 10+% day after day during the worst of it. I kept buying the dip and now I'm jacked to the MF tits and not ready to sell even when we get nice 13% days here and there.

Notice anything so far about this chart? **It loves to gap up**. This is a low float stock and the market cap is comparably small compared to competitors like MRNA, JNJ, etc. It's not uncommon to see it almost double when BIG catalysts drop and trust me when I tell you we've got ALOT of big catalysts on the menu. We've recently found a ROCK HARD floor at $170 and most recently a very strong support at $200. This stock has been severely de-risked and I think right now is still a damn good time to buy because of this asymmetrical risk.

&#x200B;

**3) Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt - Bear case and the FUD spread by short sellers**

\-*NVAX is too late to the game. The entire world is vaccinated already. Pandemic is over.* This is obviously not true and I've written extensively about it in my 2nd and 3rd posts. India, home to 1.4 BILLION people has only vaccinated a little more than 1% of its vaccination. India is currently the epicenter of the pandemic with cases going parabolic recently sadly. It should also be noted that NVAX has a [deal](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-memorandum-understanding-gavi-cumulative) with the Gavi Institute in India to manufacture and deliver 1.1 Bn doses of covid vaccines. More on India a little further down the post. Additionally, new variants continue to pop up and it seems more and more like we'll be getting covid booster shots for a while.

\-*Insiders are selling so they know something is up*. This is so stupid don't fall for this trap. They've sold days before major catalysts in the past. Everything is scheduled ahead of time and from what I understand also has something to do with them exercising their options. Let's not even mention the fact that selling millions in stock right before you drop horrible news would be the most blatant illegal insider trading ever lol

\-*NVAX is having manufacturing issues. They're not gonna be able to produce the vaccines they promised, just look at what happened to the EU deal.* I wrote about this alot in my 3rd post. I was worried at first that the raw materials they were missing perhaps was the adjuvant that comes from the soapbark trees (yikes!) However, as it turns out [the problem is actually the supply of 2,000 liter plastic bags](https://www.fiercepharma.com/manufacturing/lack-grow-bags-a-hefty-problem-for-novavax-s-covid-19-vaccine-production-push) that they need to grow their cells. The bags exist but they're currently being locked up by the US as per the Defense Production Act. Literally the US is reserving the bags for Pfizer and now the institute in India that is supposed to produce a ton of the NVAX vaccines does not have access to them. However the CEO of the institute has [publicly pleaded for Biden to lift the embargo](https://twitter.com/megtirrell/status/1383129792292167680) and it seems like their may be [some action here soon](https://twitter.com/Cold_Peace_/status/1384537640322674689) especially given the dire COVID situation in India. I honestly have no fucking idea what will happen and this is simply what I have gathered in my investigative work across sources. Any clarity or insight here is super appreciated. I don't even know if these bags are reason NVAX was having manufacturing issues for the EU. Regardless, GSK is making some of the NVAX vaccine soon and they should have some stockpiled already at least for the UK and early approvers.

\-*NVAX US phase 3 trials must have had bad results that's why they haven't released the data yet.* I saved this one for last because it's the most unlikely one in my opinion. I'd be surprised to see repeatedly stellar results in US phase 1/2, UK phase 1/2/3interim/3final trials only to see something worse than JNJ's 66% efficacy in the US/Mexico phase 3 trial.

&#x200B;

**4) Catalysts and Questions for y'all**

OK this is where I summarize what I think will happen soon and also where I need input from y'all. NVAX has completely left us bagholders (oops, I mean investors) in the dark on some of these expected dates and it has been the source of [much strife in twitter comments](https://twitter.com/Novavax/status/1384489266483433472) against the leadership and PR team of NVAX. Not gonna lie they can learn to market and pump themselves more but I appreciate their hardwork on getting the science done well regardless.

**A) Filing for UK Approval**

\-From what I understand NVAX has already begun the rolling review by the UK MHRA and EU's EMA. They have provided the interim data for UK phase 3 at least and they hopefully have also submitted the finalized UK phase 3 data at this point but I do not know. 

\-Another thing they need to submit is a CMC package. This basically is evidence they provide these regulatory agencies that their manufacturing process is robust and can produce consistent vaccine batches. I have NO idea what the status is with this (did they finish it already?) and any insight is appreciated.

\-I can only imagine they'd make an announcement when they actually file in the UK but who knows. I also am curious to know how long after filing we can expect to see approval. My hope is that this whole process will be done and the vaccine will be approved by the [end of April](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-britain-vaccine/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-could-be-approved-by-uk-in-april-evening-standard-says-idUSKBN2BM1IF).

\-Guidance on this could literally drop any day this week or next week and I'm willing to bet we'll gap up on the news as always. As soon as it's approved by the UK then Canada, Australia, and New Zealand will likely follow suit.

**B) US Phase 3 results**

\-I'm super excited this is gonna be fucking awesome

\-US/Mexico Phase 3 trials started much later than the UK phase 3 trials. People were concerned for a long time that it would take a ton of time to get results. Even NVAX executives were saying that they were gonna swing for the fences and see if the US FDA would consider an EUA just with UK data instead of having to wait for US data. 

\-Turns out there were tons of willing participants and the trial got 25,000 people signed up in record time. Additionally, waves of covid caused collection of endpoints to happen much faster than expected. TODAY they started crossover trials. This basically means that people that had received the placebo get the read vaccine and people that got the real vaccine get the placebo (they are all still blinded). What is significant about this is that [THEY WOULDN'T DO THE CROSSOVER WITHOUT FIRST GETTING ENOUGH ENDPOINTS TO FILE FOR AN EUA](https://twitter.com/NayeemTheDream/status/1384265587770023942?s=1001).

\-We basically were all but explicitly told that US phase 3 is complete and the data/news can drop any day now. Put on your spacesuits.

**C) US FDA filing**

\-NVAX is [aiming for May](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/novavax-targets-may-approval-for-covid-19-vaccine-u-s). 

\-Again, I have no idea what the status is on the CMC package for the US filing and any insight is welcome.

\-There are some [interesting speculations on twitter](https://twitter.com/Biohazard3737/status/1384595862202896385) but I have a hard time making sense of them. Take it with a grain of salt as this guy/gal says him/herself.

**D) EU Deal**

\-The EU deal fell through last month but it seems like it could be getting revived soon. They are facing pressure after the AZN shitshow. 

\-This would be an awesome catalyst but don't hold your breath these EU chiefs are slow AF and seem to be generally fumbling oftentimes when it comes to securing doses for their populace

&#x200B;

**5) My positions and good ways to play this**

\-My positions are all in on $200c 5/21 options. Like literally my whole portfolio. I don't know that I would recommend this approach for most, the IV on these options is insanely high. I do, however, expect the IV of these options to expand following one of these catalysts. I know this is the opposite of what we typically think of with IV crush following binary events. However, I think the stock is exceptionally undervalued and I DO NOT think approval has been priced in. The majority of the gain will hopefully come from intrinsic value from the calls going deep ITM but I also hope to get an IV bump as people realize that this company has a rich future ahead of it and the call options gain demand. It has been an absolutely wild ride but I'm comfortable to say I now understand the true meaning of diamond hands.

\-Shares of course (or LEAPS) are godly if you have that sort of capital. Then you can just hang on for a long time. I will definitely switch to LEAPS after this immediate saga is over. I think once NVAX starts actually making a revenue it will absolutely blow earnings out of the park.

\-If you want to take advantage of high IV then of course theta gang strategies are nice. I caution against selling calls, this stock is ready to pop. Selling puts is a good strategy though you'll miss out on the extra tendies if they go parabolic. I severely caution against close expiration put credit spreads even though they are bullish because this stock CAN be squirrely and drop 10% in a day. If your spreads close OTM you can lose it all.
