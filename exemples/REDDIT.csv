I'm an investor(ETF) since I turn 18 and active trader(Stonks) 3 years ago(not daily trader).

I see most of you need to learn what I learn in my short period of active trader, **fucking discipline and  be patient.** 

Most of newbies(myself also) when you start you look to the stonks every fucking time, stop, trace a strategy, do DD and make some math. Because one of the most, and I think remarcable fails, is when you try to catch momentum, when momentum is nearly over or will be flat during a long time, that is why people buy high and sell low, they are not stupid. They are like you and me, but they think as momentum goes the stonks will be flat or go higher. **WRONG**

Most of the time when momentum stops stonks suffer from correction or be more flat than your wife tits for a long time. If you do a nice DD and conclude stonk is under value just invest and forget about been flat or stupid fluctuations, correct your strategy over time and **stick to your fucking plan**. 

At this point if you made a correct prediction you will have gains, if don't you will lose. But either ways you will **Learn.** You can't learn a shit throwing yourself into the ""NeXt BiG ThInG"" it's okay to jump on trends but learn why are you fucking doing and avoid been a paper hand, buy high sell low.

1612440359.0,101,So let me try and understand this SEC investigation and how it is not just a MASSIVE waste taxpayer money and resources.,"People took public information about a hedge fund shorting a publicly traded company.....in attempts to hypothetically bankrupt them and profit from it from destroying all they ever worked for.

Then talked about this public information on a social media platform, because you know that is what you do on social media...talk and share ideas. So people got more excited about a stock they were already invested in and bought more. 

Then more people said hey this looks like a good stock and I can see how their recent publicly announced hiring decisions and moves could benefit me in the future, because you know I am a gamer and love their products. Plus with the strengthening of the recently suppressed economy, this company could really blow up.

So armed with this all this public info, more people decided to invest. 

Then some already known and convicted insider trader lost 53% of his investors money and had to be bailed out by the company that hired an SEC employee to speak publicly at their events.

Now all of the sudden, this same speaker is calling for an SEC investigation into the sharing of public information on social media.

1612439218.0,153,Does everyone know what time it is? Sub drama time!,"Degenerate Gamblers,

Recently, there’s been a split within the moderation team. Unfortunately, it didn’t end amicably. There are a group of us that want to push the subreddit forward and allow it to grow organically, while another group was afraid of the change that was coming and wanted to put restrictions in place to curtail that growth.

The OG mods are still here. In fact, we’ve been here every day, for hours on end working hard to help this community stay afloat and accommodate the influx of new users. There is no hedge fund attack, no grand conspiracy, just some run of the mill subreddit drama.

So let’s talk about that in a bit more detail.

The OG mods want this place to be run by the community and to grow as the community sees fit. Other mods that we placed our trust in disagree with this approach. Certain mods want to grow a personal following in their own name and act for themselves rather than acting as just one of the many wallstreetbets mods who are here to serve the community. Certain mods want to make this place political.

We tried to discuss this difference in approach and work through the issues. Some of the other mods weren’t interested in talking and chose the nuclear option. They chose to spread misinformation on the sub and in the daily threads. They chose to create stickies on the front page and in every thread. 

We had to take action to prevent this attempt to fracture the community, which resulted in some mods losing their privileges.

We didn’t take this action lightly. We know we may have hurt some feelings by doing this. But we simply refuse to stand by and watch this place be burnt to the ground. 

We were planning on waiting to announce this once we had everything lined up, but yes we have been approached by producers regarding a potential movie and many of the other mods were a part of those conversations, including /u/zjz. What wasn’t shared though, was that we are planning to donate any proceeds from this (if any!) to charity. Claiming this as evidence that we are attempting to “monetize the sub” is extremely dishonest.

We are here to protect the sub from manipulation. And we will continue to do just that, even if that manipulation comes from within and from people we once trusted."

Not all your orders actually execute to market, the organisation with the trade order can choose what to do with it. 1) send it to market so if you win the guy on the other end gets fucked or 2) internalise the trade and if you win they get fucked. The opposite of number 2 is you lose and they take your stack, all 100% of it.

The reality is 60-80% of options trades lose CFD trades are about 60% losing. Shares trades I have no fucking idea but probably more than 50% lose.

Why is this a problem? Because last / this week the guys internalizing the trades got fucking rodgered, their loss porn would have made post on here look like fucking lunch money in 1982. 

The decision to block trading certain instruments was 100% to protect the market makers, artificial market makers not the market. This might not have happened with Robin hood but you can bet your ass the pricks sucking their dick for order flow would have and this is how you end up with commission free trading.

The commission covers the trade execution at market and has some cream for everyone down the line, but the greedy pricks running this circus figured out ""why take the cream why you can just suck the milk outta the cow titty?"".

 With GME and AMC these quant betas realised the team at WSB was gonna be the 'wifes boyfriend' this time, so they fucking slashed your tyres before you could get in to smash!

Anything  under $100 is honestly not a bad entry point based on the news and positioning of the company. Fair market values of $160-$200 have been offered by others with good support considering a turn-around story. Maybe they will take the cube's advice and offer a dividend. Either way, it's going to take time and a set of catalysts to get the squeeze going again.

1. Calm the fuck down.

1612436760.0,77,Can someone check my maths on this? It's about Shortsight S3 GME Short interest %,"Ok so I'm sorry if this was old news or stupid but I'm bad at maths so I was looking up how to calculate short interest. According to [shortsight](https://www.shortsight.com/short-interest-of-float-2-0/) most firms use shorts/float, so if a company has 100 shares and someone short sells 50 shares, that would be 50%? 

But shortsight uses shortsight uses shorts / (float + longs created by shortsellers), so 50 shorts on a 100 float company would be 50/150=33%

So these past few days I've been freaking out because ""short interest"" has dropped from apparently around 120% to just under 60% but 

60% = shorts / (float + artificial longs) 
means there are 60 shorts for every 100 longs including those longs created by the shorts. Which means 60 artificial longs and 40 float. 

Which means short interest calculated by anyone else = 60/40= 150%

I think the last number I saw was 58, so 58/42=138% 

So the hedge funds haven't even closed their positions?

1612436058.0,131,Why the shakeout of paper hands is a good thing,"Paper hands folding helps with the eventual short squeeze, because those weak hands would be exactly the persons to sell at a relatively slight uptick.  

The fact that they sold for so low means they won't be adding sell pressure on the way up, instead they gave a chance to the diamond hands to buy up their shares at a discount.  

There's no free rides, for the price to go up, it has to go down first.

The more paper hands fold, the more diamond hands remain, until only diamond hands remain, and then we can set the price we want."
1612435990.0,14,Are retail shorters actually helping us out? [Theory],"I have a bit of a theory that I believe that retail shorters are actually helping us out, hear me out.

Not a financial advisor, just an ape with a dream to visit the moon.

This is regarding AMC, but could also apply for GME's current situation.

AMC currently has a reported short interest of 80% with free float of 56m shares. That means that about 44.8m of the shares in the free float have short contracts against them.

The current price drop that we saw, as funds and TUTs are trying to cover their asses, will only attract other retail shorters and institutional shorters who would bet that the price would drop even further, betting against it dropping $8 for example (For AMC).

However, what they are doing in the process is they are occupying the another % of the free float into shares that have short contracts against them - further lowering the total amount of shares that can be bought back by funds and tuts as there are fewer shares available to trade.

I feel like, not only are funds trying to make paper hands to sell their shares which they hold, so there's more supply in the market that will allow to cover the demand without spiking the price like crazy, but also they are trying to lower the price to a point where retail shorters would exercise their short contracts and return a % of the shares back into the public float.

If we were to look at a hypothetical:

Let's say that there are currently 100 shares (float). 80% of them are held by institutions as short interest - they have borrowed them and sold them in the market. That means that tuts need to buy back at least 80% of the float of the market to return to their ""owner"".

Let's hypothetically say that we, retail investors and institutional investors, own 15% of the free float. But what happens with retail shorters who enter the market, borrow existing shares (presumably from the 15% that we occupy to sell and return to the market. Let's say that they are currently taking up another 10% of the shares. Occupying an even higher amount of shares in the free float with short contracts against them. So, they borrow the shares that were already a part of the supply from the institutional shorters who sold in the market and was consequently bought from a retail investor or institutional investor. If the retail shorters buy back the shares that they have shorted, to return, that's fine for institutional shorters as the float is in their advantage. But if the price does not drop to a point that is comfortable for retail shorters, that leaves them with even less of wiggle room where they will have to buy at an even higher price than the market price.

So in the case of our example of 100 shares, that means that now they have 90% of shares in the float that have short contracts against them with 15% ownership. Meaning that 5% of the shares need to be bought back from second demand instead of primary demand - thus driving the price at which they can buy them back further up, thus further increasing the price of the stock, thus causing the institutional shorters to pay an even higher price, which will further drive up the market price.

Does this make any sense? I kind of suck at explaining shit.

That or I'm just full of shit.

My point being **(TL:DR)** is that, institutional shorters need to drive the price down further not only to make us sell, but to also incentivise retail shorters into exercising their contracts and thus returning the supply back to meet demand, otherwise that would lead to an even higher price jump.

Regardless, I'm holding. I believe in the cause and if it exposes market makers and institutional ownership of our ""free market"" at the cost of me losing some money (that i'm comfortable losing), then it's a win in my book.

I like the stock. I have spoken.

P.S This is not financial advise. I am not trying to create expectation, but I just have a speculation. The more we talk about this as a collective, the more educated decisions people on this board can make. After all, we are acting as an open access hedge fund at this point lol.

1612435860.0,14,GSK Share price rock bottom? Is now the time to get in?,"After poor figures yesterday GlaxoSmithKlein, UK pharmaceutical company, may be the perfect investment.

1612435830.0,133,"I figured out what is going on with GME, listen","Okay fellow retards, i am either going full retard or full Michael Burry right now.

While my girlfriend was out with her boyfriend and i was playing with my Lego, i figured out what is going on, i am gonna make it very simple, because my brain does not allow me to make complex thoughts, so here goes.

First, we know that Melvin cuckital and other Hedge bros shorted heavily GME, the SI was 200069% and the strike should be fairly low, which leads to a short squeeze, now at this point the losses they were looking at was at the Billions or more ( that's a lot of money, in case you dont understand). A lot of apes here think that they are trying to floor the stock so they can cover their asses and not pay out, but here is the catch, THEY DON'T.

If HFs have so much power to destroy a stock while the price and volume is so fucking high combined with the fact that they can do this while the world is looking at them, then they would be Gazillionaires by now. If a HFs can create so much swing in a stock like GME, then what prohibits them from doing so in a smaller stock with much lower volume and make a shit ton of money all the time, the SEC ??? Fucking lmao if you thought that

My point here is, that we are overestimating their powers and i am going to explain why.

We got the news that shorts covered their positions, which everyone thought was BS, but i believe they actually did, and here is how.

We know that Melvin got around 50 Bn capital a few days ago, so how did they persuade investors to give them money??? Did they tell them they will try to manipulate the stock and bet that people will sell off, do you think rich people heard that and said ""Oh yeah, great idea, lets bet 50bn that retarded apes will panic and sell off"", fuck no, they proposed a real plan, that would not bet on us doing sane things and i am gonna tell you their plan and why it makes sense.

They know that GME is a ticking bomb, they know that people want GME to MOON, so they hedged their bets by manipulating the stock to drop at 80-90, possibly lower and buy a fuck ton of calls to hedge their retarded bet.
They feed the MSM with BS, manipulate the market, so the price drops, then they buy a fuck ton of calls/shares so they will limit their losses or even make more money. S3 partners, media, RH have started acting like our friends now, isnt this a bit suspicious??? It is, because they now want the stock to fucking rocket, so their friends can get their money back.

So what happened is, Melvin got money to buy calls, fed media BS to drop the price and buy calls at good prices, now the media,S3 and RH are with us, the stock will rocket and they will hedge their bets and cover their asses, it all makes sense.

1612435188.0,362,Lets Look at GME from a NON-BIAS standpoint,"**THIS IS NOT FINANICAL ADVICE I AM NOT A PROFFESIONAL SO PLEASE DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH AS WELL.**

***I will simplify this very easily so new retards can understand this simply.***

1. Short Interest: ***This is ultimately why we got in***. **I don't care if you like the stock or not. We all want money at the end of the day, and that's the truth.** We really want those who shorted the shares to finally buyback the shares. The interest rate did drop from 140 to 120. This was a guarantee on the robinhood fiasco day. **That was only 20%**. And we got the confirmation from multiple sources. I am using highshortinterest.com which I do understand is not updated as frequently but it did update on that day. It comes as a huge surprise to me that 120 dropped to 51%. Either they bought it from other hedge funds at a background deal, or the day Robinhood manipulated the prices down, that rise up was the shorts selling. Thus we got back to 300ish from the low of 110. In this case, it has squeezed. **In the case it hasn't, the shorts are actually screwed if we just hold (we need a short interest update with actual legitimate facts, I do not know where to get this information besides the website stated. Do not listen to S3 partners, as they have gone back and forth with bs. Its an estimate)**

&#x200B;

2) **GME & AMC are following the exact same pattern**. This is a huge sign of manipulation. Although that shouldnt come as a surprise. When Robinhood let traders sell, shorts were able to cover for cheap as fuck. **THEY COMPLETELY SCREWED THE MOMENTUM, HOWEVER THIS CAN EASILY CHANGE, AS THERE ARE MORE BUYERS THEN SELLERS.**

3) **Silver diversion**: Let me just say this. GME AND AMC are basically the same situation but different Short interest. **If they wanted to divert from GME, they should of said we moved to AMC. But no they specifically mentioned silver. That is a huge sign, and this cannot be understated more that they want to close the movement.** You really need to think about how the news is reflecting this, and how it still continues to reflect it.

4)  GME is still testing grounds: GME is actually hovering 80-100. Like actually??? How is this even possible. We are still in the squeeze.  **If it crashed we would actually be at 40 right now.**

5) Short Ladder attacks: I was super hesitant to believe this shit. There's no actual sources, but we do have crammer in a video saying what hedge funds do in desperate circumstances.  The legimatacy of short ladder attacks is comparable to the following: This is basically like saying the assassination of Kennedy was not an actual hit, and when cocaine was brought into America, we just didn't have the resources to stop it from coming.

**I AM GOING TO BE HONEST, people definitely paper handed at this short ladder attack**. **This would actually bring their short interest down a bit, while keeping the stock price at a safe level.**

&#x200B;

6) **People are on our side. Listen carefully. We can actually win. I was retarded and thought this was going to be easy.** Of course it wasn't gonna be. Did you know why the Volkswagen short squeeze happened? Because one smart dude decided to hold and not sell, forcing high interest rates and shorts getting margin called. This is inevitable if we drive the price back up, they will be forced to buyback the shares.  **WE ALSO HAVE THAT ONE DIAMOND BALLS FCKER> DFV.**

&#x200B;

TLDR: HOLD 🚀🚀🚀

Saxo are quoting 2-3 bank days to process  accounts. Degiro are quoting up to 10 working days for information to be verified. I'm not sure how many recently afflicted retards are effected by this but it could be anything between a little and a lot. The long wait time suggests it is more than a little; otherwise why the long wait time? Either way it is highly likely that there are retail investor tendies out that want to be invested in owning GME but have been put on hold by the brokers. That demand is still there in the background and it will eventually manifest in the market. What do I think this will mean for the GME price? No idea but I'd be interested in opinions...

TL;DR - Hold reinforcements are coming  


Edit: I know some applications are processing faster - but some are not. Like any theme park the popular rides have long lines regardless of how fast they are moving. What is of interest to me is the length of the line and how it might manifest."

I was told they were due all days this week and that everyone should hold until at least Friday (some said Thursday, today), can we expect the squeeze to happen today or tomorrow, or are we right now just holding to fuck with the hedge funds (which I have no trouble doing)?

Would love some answers on this, not because I'm cashing out but because there seems to be conflicting information everywhere regarding this."
1612432276.0,141,Thoughts from a diamond handed noob,"Just wanted to get a few things off my chest here. Perhaps just the ramblings of a pissed off American.

First off, I’m new here. I caught the hype train and got in too late. Figured it could go either way but was worth a shot. Who knows what could still happen, but you know what? I WILL NOT SELL THESE SHARES! If this stock goes down to 10 cents/share I WILL STILL HOLD. Idgaf. Here’s why:

It has NEVER been more obvious to me that the playing field is not even. We are so outgunned and outmatched it’s ridiculous. IM SICK OF IT. I watched all these paper handed tards come in here, buy stock, then cower and  fall for the HF/Uber Wealthy’s scare tactics. 

I have known for a long time (as Im sure most/all of you do) that the people with insane amounts of money run the entire fucking world. Everyone knows that. This week was the first time I’ve witnessed the impact of their lying, corrupt, human garbage ways in real time. I watched them deny potential retail investors, Manipulate the market RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE WORLD, spread false narratives in the media, distract us with silver, DIVIDE AND CONQUER, and use scare tactics to get people to sell. AND all you dumbass paper handed fucks fell for it and played right into their hand. 

This is about more than money. Of course, I’d LOVE to make some on this stock, but I truly don’t give a shit if I do or not. I WILL NOT GET ON MY KNEES AND GET IN LINE FOR THEM. This is a principled stand against the puppet masters. Wake the fuck up and realize that these people are the real enemy. They will steamroll anyone and anything in their path. They will destroy anything they can if it means they get deeper pockets. They will do anything to keep us common apes from coming to their doors.. no matter how many lives get destroyed. 

To be clear, I don’t blame anyone for cutting their losses at this point. People invested way more than they could afford, which was your first mistake. If selling your shares is what’s best for you and your family, make that choice and go forward with a clear conscience. I just truly hope that people have learned something here. Not only about how to invest.. but about the system. I sure as hell have. 

End rant. There’s more I want to say but this should suffice. 

All I know is that you OG diamond hands can count on me to hold onto GME. I will not fucking sell. Proud to be a member of this sub."

1612432002.0,95,Persevere my fellow a$$tronauts,"We all wanna be the protagonist of our movie. We see ourselves as the hero in the leather jacket with a devil may care attitude and a massive 3.5 inch c0ck. But how does a hero become a hero. Does he just get lucky? No. Does he get what he wants easy? No. Does he crawl and mooch his way to the top like a right kuk? No. What does he do? He Perseveres. When he's down at the bottom he reflects on that and he does what he has to. He. Perseveres. He continues on the path that is shitty and dirty and riddled with non believers to get where he wants to get.

I remember when GME was on the fucking rise, wallstreetbets was everywhere. Every other post on the front page, on twitter, people associating themselves with it. And now that GME is in the red, people mock us. They call us fools for standing up to the big boys. This. Is. A. Test. Fack those flaky motherfacking captain hindsight non believing cunts. All you have to do is know that we are still here. We might not be as visible or audible as before, but we, The Holders, ARE HERE!

So if tomorrow GME goes further down and people start throwing sh!te at us calling us retards for backing the wrong f***ing horse, just know one thing- THE HOLDERS ARE HERE. And they are holding. The doubters are here too. The naysayers. The bots. The clowns. The schadenfrauding aholes who get hard when they see other people lose. The trolls. They all are here but they DONT MATTER. All that matters is the cause. And the cause is- to make some mafking money! And we will get there. Together. $1000 is still not a fucking meme. No bell no sell.

1612431972.0,131,GME is floating around $90. Has anyone considered the alternative scenario where people can't trade because they're moving accounts from Robinhood?,"I think there isn't enough ""buying"" momentum simply because of the backlogs and verification processes of firms that are seeing a sudden influx of people signing up to trade with them. They weren't prepared to handle that sudden rush of customers and now they're sifting through accounts activating them, receiving funds, etc.

I don't think the week will end well for GME (and by that I mean its not going to start going up). I think next week is going to be a bull run when trading companies work through the weekend to clear up the back log of new customers.

Also, has everyone forgotten about BB and AMC? I expect a rally for AMC coming soon.

1612431407.0,0,≥100% SI is NOT conclusive proof of naked shorting,"Here's why.

I'm fucking broke because I bought GME at $350 and 🧻👐 on Tuesday. This means that when I run out of instant lemonade to snort and need more, I go get a grand from a payday lender. There is now $1,000 of debt (owned by the payday lender) and $1,000 of cash (owned by me). 

The day after I take out my loan, my cousin Dan comes whining to me because his deathtrap beater broke down. (He shorted GME at $5 during the summer, so he's even more broke than I am.) Since I'm a sap, I loan him enough to get it fixed, say $500. Remember, I'm broke too, so that $500 comes out of the $1,000 I got from the payday lender.

Here's the important part: There is still only $1,000 of cash ($500 owned by Dan, $500 by me), but the amount of debt has gone up to **$1,500** ($500 owned by me, and the original $1,000 owned by the payday lender). **This is not illegal**, or even against the rules (to a greater extent than that the payday lender will be squeezing my balls, so I have a strong incentive to get up Dan's ass about his share—but at the end of the day that's a problem for the three of us and the local law enforcement couldn't give a shit).

*Shares that are sold short are just shares to the people who buy them, so they can usually be borrowed and sold short again*. This makes it possible for a stock to have, in theory, infinity% SI without a single naked short existing. 

Do naked shorts of GME probably exist anyway? If the fail-to-deliver statistics that have been posted here are remotely accurate, I would lean strongly towards yes. Is it still retarded to short a stock ≥100% of float (and will that probably produce a short squeeze)? Also yes. Does shorting still dilute the market and expose the shorter to significant risk even if it's not naked? Yes. But none of those mean you should go around stating GME's SI (real, theoretical, or historical) as any kind of proof that it's been shorted naked. Get better evidence and know what you're talking about."

Look at your options: either sell now and lose for sure, or hold on and potentially win.  Yes, you may lose more if you hold, but losses are guaranteed if you pull out now. I, personally, am down 50% of a 30k buy in at $180. If I sell, I'm out $15k guaranteed. I can reinvest that money, but I would need a 100% gain to get it back.  That sort of win usually requires a high risk gamble, and usually doesn't pan out.  So why not hold instead?  Let's see the plan through. It may not hit 1k, 5k, or 10k.  But if we hold, we can get back to 400.  Maybe even 500 or 600.  Maybe even more. Who knows. But what we do  know is that selling is a guaranteed loss. Up to you."

NIO is planning on building a ""world class electric vehicle campus"" in the city of Hefei--further strengthening a collaboration that NIO has with the municipal government of Hefei; this is BIG!

As stated by cnEVpost [here](https://cnevpost.com/2021/02/04/nio-to-build-world-class-smart-ev-industrial-park-in-hefei/), NIO will jointly build ""The Hefei Xinqiao Smart Electric Vehicle Industrial Park, the name of the campus, will integrate R&D, manufacturing, pilot demonstration and applications, and industrial support services, and will be built with leading international industrial innovation capacities and scale, NIO said"".

Furthermore, Gasgoo revealed something very interesting in their article on this big news too--here's the [link](http://autonews.gasgoo.com/70017970.html), and what they say is this: ""The signing of the framework agreement marks another significant milestone of the profound strategic partnership between NIO and Hefei. **The Hefei government and its associated parties plan to re-invest their returns from the equity investments in NIO China to support the further NIO**""

Anyone sleeping on NIO is insane at this point; NIO will be enormous in the future; and all the partnerships and collaborations that work in NIO's favor attest to this fact--in fact, you may not need to wait very long to NIO go considerably higher; they could easily be above $100-150+ this year alone!

Huge rewards will go to the smart long term investors.

Don't forget, only spend what you can afford to lose in the worst case scenario. I bought some stocks because I can afford to lose it all and it won't make a difference to my financial circumstances. 

We all knew HF were crooks and never played fairly; the GME move just proved this fact and illustrated that these scums will do anything in their power, including but not limited to, openly breaking the laws and regulation, in order to win. Needless to say, they must be so frustrated right now because none of their tactics have really worked: market manipulation (stopping the public from buying freely by bribing shit brokers like RH), ladder attack (selling to their own partners to bring the price down), use of media to spread fake news, bribing government officials and so on. I feel like the more they try the more they fail. 

I'm sure our FCA is a lot better than your SEC when it comes to bringing the scums down. It seems your SEC is ran by some cowboys / sponsored lawyers. What I don't understand is what in the world is FBI doing when HF are openly committing crime in daylight?!

I've been really depressed for months and always have suicidal thoughts throughout my life and last week I was feeling very low and heard of all this GME and the positivity of it all and down with it, I was in need of a little happiness and good fortune while helping others at the same time. 

I don't have a lot but I put in everything I had $100 @ 338 and then $400 @ 330 to hold for a longtime and then bought more, the money I needed to live on to try cover my loss as I thought it would go up within a few days. I own 3.28 shares. With a -$650 loss starting with $900

But Its now looking like I will have to sell everything at about $90 as I'm completely out of money and in debt. 

I feel sick, cheated and now even more broke and broken. 

It's not right the criminal activity and manipulation of the hedge funds lowering the value of the shares! 

The incorrect information and lies from mainstream media and manipulation to drive people not to buy resulting in the share value going down. 

Restricting free trade by many trading apps not allowing people to buy and only sell. 
Hugely impacting the value by causing panic and mass selling resulting in the value of shares going down. 

Where is the justice and hope for the small people if we are restricted from fair trade. 

Hope it rockets after I'm out you all make life changing gains if I wasn't in debt and broke I would hold 


Edit: I know it was completely my mistake putting the money i needed in. And the blame is completely my own and I will suffer because of that. I've never gambled before but then we could say everything we do in life is a gamble. But I thought of it as a investment to hold and something to actually own. 

900 is a lot for me as I currently don't work due to my mental health. I'm a ex soldier and 33. 
I did do my research and wouldn't say I'm dumb just a very bad, stupid decision after the money i was going to hold with. Maybe my mental health played apart of that or I was just not thinking in the moment. 

Thanks for the positive comments and messages from others that have suffered also. 
And thanks for constructive criticism it helps also.

To all the ppl telling me to hold out longer I wish I could.

1612427830.0,118,A non-technical take on AMC,"I'm a measly 40 @ 8.52 for now (buying tmrw), and I am fully dedicated to AMC and will be holding and investing everything I can afford for the long play. Right now for the reason of the movement, but here is another major reason why I know it, and other theaters will blow.

Think about it, the future of workmanship, UBI, AI taking over jobs, it will pressure society to rethink what it means to live and enjoy life in the next 10 years.

What does one do if they have free money, no work, and the desire to do SOMETHING?

They do one (or more) of 3 major things:

- They learn / explore
- They socialize / connect
- They have fun / seek entertainment

AMC is step 3 of this societal change, but most importantly, step 2 as well. It resolves the human desire to both socialize and be entertained.

That is why I am convinced things like digital/physical entertainment will blow up like mad. It seems trivial, but old school physical theatres are going to be huge as we go back to our roots. There is also a massive opportunity in VR as well.

What are your thoughts on entertainment stocks outside of this movement?

Edit: To add, I think this interest for physical entertainment will never die down as humanity advances because once we peak in terms of mobile / VR technology, we will be far more intrigued to go back to our roots. Its for this reason that physical sports will never die. The reason athletes arent just hopping on digital hockey, soccer, football etc."

-Commenting multiple times on different threads within minutes/seconds
-Copy and pasted comments in different threads
-Silent/Lurker accounts becoming suddenly vocal
-Purchases of Reddit gold?
-Accounts and posts being deleted if being downvoted by apes too hard

It's the first point that makes me think there is a bot brigade as everyone suspects.

I'm not going to name names but just try this. Go to rising, find a negative post/comment insulting the person or user for their comment/submission i.e. 'idiot' or 'ban' etc. Then have a look at that negative bastards history.

Combined with some vesting schedule like perhaps 3 years where the contract is void if they leave the company.

If I was sitting on shorty mc shorts this would scare the hell out or me. 

The next step would then be to slowly and steadily release news about the new strategy. One little piece at a time, a few days apart, for a very very long time. Together with a charming communication strategy which rally employees, fans of the company, and us who Like the Stock. You are recommended and more than welcome to belong to all three of these categories if you ask me. 

We like the Stock!

In the middle of this rallying movement also bring on the news about RC himself increasing his position towards 19.99%, in several small batches so those news can hit outlets and the street in a flow. 

Beneath all this there are us in GME Gang, old and new members with Diamond Hands and conviction. APES TOGEHER!

Also keep up the relentless vigilante billboard campaign, in the long run this kind of movement is supporting the chances of an epic turnaround to succeed. Imagine going to work at your local GameStop store in the morning and you see one of these beauties, I would be inspired to stick around and do my best. 

This entire event around the Short Squeeze, the politics, the story, has put the brand on the radar of the entire world in a way rarely seen, it is value in itself to be added to the fundamentals of the company. If I wanted to buy a brand awareness campaign for the company I work at we would need to fork up more money than the GameStop current market cap, not kidding.

  
GameStop, like a Phoenix, rises from the smoldering ruins of its own history. This is my prediction and it is one demanding patience.

1612427334.0,0,"Parents say I cannot invest in stocks due to the nature of my dad's job, are there any other feasible ways I can gain a substantial amount of money to pay for college?","So I'm a 19 year old college kid who's struggling to pay for college and just generally sustaining myself through life (food, paper towels, tissues, laundry stuff, cleaning stuff, haircuts, etc.).  My parents are barely helping me at all (I have to pay out of my own pocket for sustaining myself as well as the majority of my tuition) and I wanted to join you guys and try to make a bunch of money through investing. The problem though is that my parents, especially my dad, aren't letting me invest in any stocks because my dad works for a bank that doesn't want its employees to invest in stocks because ""things can get too complicated with conflicts of interest"". 

I really need the money for a legit purpose and it sucks because I see so many people, especially kids around my age, making shit tons of money from investing with your sub's advice in mind and I feel really left out. Taking the Wall Street Bets route to success seems like the perfect opportunity to help pay for my college tuition as well as helping sustain myself. Even though I'm legally an adult, I'm still legally a ""dependent"" (which is ironic because I have to be INdependent most of the time) and don't have much autonomy.

So, my question to y'all is how can I make a substantial amount of money to help me move forward if I don't have the option to invest in stocks?  Is the Wall Street Bets life a dream that will never come true for me, in your opinion?"

For starters, look into ""bear raids."" Just Google bear raids and you will see that they're (usually) pretty freakin' illegal. And if you've been a real wsb 🦍 who's been following what's going on (no, not that garbage on cnn, wsj, etc.) you'll see that what RH, the HF, etc did/still-doing is a transparently illegal bear raid. And this doesn't just involve SEC acts but also other fields of law, like freakin' RICO. I shit you not here is case law: Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited v. S.A.C. Capital Management, LLC (2017)

The defendants here did the exact same thing we KNOW Melvin, RH, and all those other guys did (I would actually argue the case is much more severe in our current situation) and the other guys almost got hit with a RICO but barely got out on jurisdictional technicality.

Deepfuckingvalue, who was unfortunately outed, is increasingly looking like that person. 

He is now in more danger than any of us. I doubt that anything will acruallly come of this, but now real heat is coming out, as tends to when traditional power dynamics are upset. 

Not to mention; despite the fact that he was acting as a private individual and not actually acting in an official or financial position, the optics are being set up against him. 

Do not attack him if he decides to withdraw all today. He has his own life and family to protect. He’s also much more vulnerable than anyone here, and he doesn’t have the polemical connections like citadel does. Not to mention he just screams boomer bait. 

I suspect he’s feeling pressured into not selling because of the cult status he has here. But his own personal life comes first. Chances are, he may never be able to work in an official financial position again. 

I’m not crying for his financial future or anything, he’s worth 8 figures. But again, he needs that money given his position. For the rest of his life he will be a political prop. Please respect his decisions and most importantly realize he’s a fucking human being with his own life

No one individual gets to set the price of a stock, a stock price is completely based on supply and demand. No one individual gets to say I can't buy this stock at 233. Imagine not letting people buy Tesla because they say it is not worth 810 billion dollars as of today. When would a brokerage ever try and stop retail from losing money? They only stopped buying because there was risk of an infinite squeeze. This is not a reason to halt buying, they halted buying not just for those at risk of not being able to pay, they halted buying for EVERYONE. Anyone with one ounce of economics knows if you stop allowing buying you completely shift your supply and demand graph to the right cratering shares. 

Think about it. There is a BIGGER question here. Something very fishy is going on.

To the uninformed and to those paid to ignore it, it makes sense. However, those of us with a bit of memory, this is BS. It is Bs because one of RH's strategies was supposed to be getting rid of middlemen. In 2018 they were gloating about having built their own clearing house:

I feel like I need to say something so people don't $ROPE thinking they have no other choice but to pray for a squeeze.

I need people to understand that not selling (depending on the stock) is also losing because of OPPURTUNITY COST. I am not telling you to sell if this was fun money for you, but I see people taking out fucking loans to play a momentum run that prior to this only ranged between $3-$25 per share for the last 4 years. 

Yes I understand Cohen can make changes to make GME a successful businesses, but understand it can take years. If you bought at 300-500 you will basically NEED a short squeeze to get out of those positions.  If your paper loss is already -75%, than ya, probably just hold, but do what is best for YOU.

The heavy realized loss that I took from my last GME trade hurt a lot, but I took my remaining capital and made a good chunk of my loss back up already (BA and MSFT). Sometimes you need to be proactive and not wait/pray for a short squeeze to happen. 

For example: If I have a position in AAPL and for whatever reason it drops 30%, I wont sell it since I know it will eventually come back and just collect dividends during the wait because of AAPL's FUNDAMENTALS. 

People need to understand that GME was a high risk high reward play. If you believe that this stock was manipulated, then what makes you think they will stop now? If you are confident in your position then hold.

I pray that a short squeeze does happen since I sympathize with people that lost their fucking life savings on this play, but at the end of the day you need to do what is best for YOU."

1612423471.0,27,Genuinely curious for some answers on this:,"EDIT: Can y’all PM me answers I can’t read the comments... :(

So, if the valuation is $30, why is it still at $100 even after all the buying restrictions? Why wasn’t it just a pump to 400, instead of that being the low number the squeeze went to compared to what was predicted on over 100% shorts. 

Why was $400 the peak of the “squeeze” and not the price because of the *viral* interest it had and a basement level ease of entry at $1 for a fractional share... before they restricted us from buying to really start the gamma squeeze?

Why are people saying that it can’t go up when we haven’t seen the data about the actual percentage of short positions we want to see that’s being released on the 9th? Why not hold until then at least so we know the whole story before selling?

Stocks go up and down, and if we’re still pushing the $100 mark after all that we went up against so far, who’s to say we can’t keep up the pressure and keep the price there? And even if it dips lower, people can take the income tax reduction or buy more at the lower price and average out eventually, and there’s good prospects for its future with its new leadership team I think. It’ll eventually go up in price, most of these people are millennials and will be alive when the price of every stock is 10x higher in general anyway in 2050 or whatever if they just hold... Heck, I’ve rode other stocks and stuff through worse swings than this, I’m young and believe that everything’s gonna inflate in value after this whole “millennial trading hype” becomes the norm amongst people with smartphones and access to fractional shares.

Also, what’s to stop them from allowing this new influx of excited people who are catching on running it up to 500 or whatever and them going, “look, the squeeze happened!”, when it’s just a pump in price? And then people miss out on the real squeeze? I say just hold regardless.

That’s just what I believe. But I’m not a financial advisor and don’t suggest anyone trade based off my comments. I just believe in GameStop 🤷🏻‍♂️

1612423245.0,138,Can we agree that Fidelity’s App is hot garbage,"Hello fellow autists 🦍. I come before you today to enlist your help in submitting a formal request to Fidelity to fix that God awful thing they call an app. 

After last week’s obvious attempt to thwart retail investors I decided to take my talents to Fidelity, and by talents I mean net loss portfolio. By the way, dont be me. While transferring your portfolio your stocks are frozen so you lose the ability to sell your stocks. So if GME and AMC had skyrocketed to 1,000,000,000 and then quickly shot back down to $0.01 during the transfer, I literally wouldve had to say GG. The squeeze would have been squoze ladies and ladies. Dont. Do. What. I. Did. Just wait for this all to be over then bounce they way GME will bounce then head for the moon.

Anyway, now that i’m on Fidelity, im happy to be on a platform that actually looks out for the little guy and doesnt mind the poor steal from the rich but jesus christ is this user interface GARBAGE. To check your positions and watchlist you have to engage with a Microsoft Excel-like sliding page which is a pain. You also have to change your account setting (see [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8zg30/fidelity_users_beware/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)post) when you create it in order to get live charts as opposed to the default 15-minute late charts that you open your account . And even if they were live charts, on the app the charts themselves are nothing compared to that of Robinhood’s charts. (Honestly none of that matters because I cant read anyway)

But seriously until the app gets a makeover i’ll probably end up using Robinhood just to look at charts and Fidelity to enter. I know it’s a pain in the ass but i’m hardheaded and wanna feeling like im sticking it to “the man”.

So again, I ask that as a unit we make something shake and actually get Fidelity to make their app more user friendly for us retarded folk.

1. If they purchased the shorts as part of Melvin, can the company just declare bankruptcy and default on their payments/requirement to pay back their shares?
2. Is anybody else concerned that they're just buying time to store all their money offshore in some safe account right now and then will just default on their shorts (again I don't know if this is even possible).

The only justification for keep Citadel LLC on the cap table is that it ensures Robinhood always has access to a market maker in Citadel Securities, but there are others on the market. I'm just not sure if people they are the same shitty, less shitty, or more shitty.

**Edit for clarity:** Citadel LLC, Griffin's Hedge Fund, is rumored to also be an **equity investor** in Robinhood.

1612421578.0,670,Simple explanation of why I’m still holding 530 shares of GME,"I just join WSB last week and I’m happy to be with you retards on this journey. As a fellow retard I’m not well versed the mechanical jargon of wall street. I know enough to understand what is going on, but I’ve always stayed away from shorting, margin, or options. So honestly, my smooth ape brain hurts reading about short ladder attacks, ITM/OTM contracts, and naked shorts. I’m sure the 6 million new subscribers feel the same way. So I’m going to break down in super simple terms why I’m still holding the stock.

First though, it’s important to face reality. This movement to take on the hedge funds has died down. WSB was getting over 1 million new subscribers per day and now it’s only gaining maybe 100,000 subscribers. The google trend data for GME stock shows significantly less traffic. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d3wb3rberef61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=95dcdb0f6da867d48f75d4c550ecf3022e2d9d9e

Also, a ton of paper handed fucks sold their positions and gave billions back to the hedge funds. 

Since there are less people joining and at lot of people who have sold out of GME, there is a significantly less of a forced short squeeze. BUT IM STILL NOT SELLING. WHY? I’ll break it down with super simple math that even an ape can do.

According to Yahoo Finance there are 47 million shares in the public float. Meaning shares available for the public to trade. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lnzbtfifref61.png?width=473&format=png&auto=webp&s=22ebb708330316cf3f3c2f0ece4ae1049c9a8506

&#x200B;

There are 8.5 million subscribers on WSB. If each subscriber held an average of 5.5 shares, WSB would control the entire float! If the entire float was owned by WSB, then WSB would literally control the price of the stock. 

Yes, I know that not all 8.5 million subscribers are going to buy GME. And even if WSB did, a lot of retards have paper hands and would sell early. Also, many subscribers are just here to enjoy the show or are bots. 

But let’s pretend that just 25% have diamond hands and buy GME. That would mean there would be 2.125 million people buying the stock. If 25% each bought an average of 22 shares, WSB would control the entire float. 

2.125 million x 22 = 46.75 million

This is definitely possible, although not probable given the recent developments. However, the risk vs reward is still very lucrative.  I created a probability table and assigned a probability of GME hitting certain prices. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l2yc12qhref61.png?width=488&format=png&auto=webp&s=36dc52815b342660fef85a02e08597c2d924ad65

According to my table, I estimate that the probability that GME will go to $75 or less at 73%. However, in the event that WSB controls the shares of GME, the price would skyrocket. It doesn’t matter if the short interest is at 100%, 50%, or 25%, there will be shorts that need to cover and there will be no supply. 

I believe I’m being very conservative with my estimates on the upside. I assign a 27% chance that the price of the stock would go to $150 or more. Out of the 27%, I only give a 1% chance that the price will go to 2000. 

If you take all of the prices and assign a probability to each price, you get a weighted average price of $182

Given the current price of $89 that would represent a 104% return. 

To be clear, I am in no way telling WSB to buy GME in order to gain control of the price. I’m just saying, if WSB happens to control it, the upside will be significant if one were to get in at this price, but what do I know. I’m just a monkey, ape, retard, idiot, autist, blah blah blah.

1612421247.0,5838,DONT BUY INTO THE PANIC. HOLD THE LINE,"Fellow Autists and Retards we can win and here's why

I’m going to try and keep this as straightforward as possible as I’ve been seeing tons of posts with complicated shit that I can’t read and that. I also think we are complicating this situation more than we need to.

**I don’t need to understand every detail about the situation to understand when my enemy is weak and beat down.** The media has been trying to push the narrative that the shorts have been covered and we have lost; however, I can hardly see how this could be possible. Again, I’m not sure how this all works in terms of details but what I do know is that **this is an unprecedented event.** Everyone over the course of the past weeks has been claiming that this was going to be the biggest squeeze ever and would alter the financial landscape. Despite this I have yet to see it come true.

**GME was shorted something like \~140% a few weeks ago, but I simply cannot believe that the hedgie scumbags would’ve taken a substantial loss and covered their shorts at any point last week, it was simply too expensive and the volume wasn’t there**. Although one of you is probably typing some complicated ass essay about how they could’ve covered their shorts I’m going to ask a simple question. **Why would these hedgie scums be investing time and money to short ladder attack GME today, especially since they’re claiming they’ve covered? THIS DOESN’T MAKE SENSE AT ALL.**

Now I could be wrong, but to me, **this seems like the bully on the playground**. We as retards cannot read the minds of the hedge funds nor do we understand their sorcery. What we do know is **💎 MF 🙌. What I’m trying to say is that the playground bully aka the hedge funds are assholes and trying to push us around and convince us that we’ve lost through ladder attacks, spreading claims of covering, and manipulating the markets. BUT what we must remember bullies act for a reason** whether it’s a shitty home situation, your wife not getting piped down by her boyfriend or **not covering your shorts.** I’m convinced they havent covered their shorts and today the only people selling are 📝 **🙌 betas.**

Retards we have not lost. Our enemy is trying to scare us. We’ve been saying it for days. They’ve been doing all the dirty tricks, and I know we always say we will HOLD, but seriously if **WE HOLD THEY HAVE TO COVER AT SOME POINT.**

LOOK PAST THE BULLY ON THE PLAYGROUND POINT OUT HIS FLAWS. **THEY ARE FUCKING WITH US AND THIS IS THE FIRST TEST OF MANY. THEY HAVEN’T COVERED SHIT.** Look at the damage we have caused so far, look how they're counting us out. **Show them how retarded we can be and HOLD THIS SHIT.**

Look at the retard commenting above you and below you. They’re holding and you better be too. Don’t let them down. We like this stock, the stock is great. TOGETHER WE CAN WIN. But only together. Cuban was right, we need to show them strength in numbers. **Why would a billionaire side with a bunch of retards if he didn’t know we had something going, something special?**

Now look, many of you sold today, and I get it. It’s hard when you have to look at the red and see your money drop. But what about the spaceship. The spaceship never broke down, it was broken and flawed since the beginning, but we found how to fix it. **Get back on the ride together and lets soar, beyond the moon.** **Robinhood upped the amount you can buy.** Now’s a great chance to get in on this great stock because it’s only going up and it’s cheap for what it will be worth in the future.

**HOLD. THE. FUCKING. LINE. BUY. THE. DIP**

I bought 4 shares @ $335 and for a broke college student like me its quite a bit. And I know it’s not much compared to DFV, and many others but if we all can see the strength in numbers each share is worth so much more.

&#x200B;

**TL:DR: They haven’t covered shit. We are not losing, and we can still win. But only if we work together and hold.**

1612420451.0,97,Request for DD on actually liking the stock $GME,"This is all new to me. My husband and my boyfriend are a finance dude, but many of the questions I’ve asked have stretched their knowledge on the matter. Especially on this stock which has more to do with psychological warfare than with the F-word (fundamentals). After today and the announcements from GameStop it got me wondering...  

First, I know that at some point, Game Stop repurchased a bunch of their own shares. They knew something before most did, and that was that they were putting some real money and effort behind amping up their image and offering. I heard they closed down locations, did a sale/lease deal with their warehouse locations, and even sold off the firm’s jet, just in order to buy more of their own stock.  

So they’re invested, just like we are, into the price of this stock. I believe that, because they’re invested like us, they’re likely to work on a strategy that would be beneficial to all of us as well. I know we can’t compare ourselves to the VW squeeze- we lack the element of surprise and an instant lack of stocks to purchase the same way they did. However... what are the mechanics of if some other company came in and announced that they were/had bought in to GME? Could they have done this already without our knowing? What would they have to do if they wanted to? Just seems like a decent play and I’m trying to learn more about how this shit works. What other possible plays could GameStop make which would be good for them but also good for us?  

Do other hedge funds have a benefit if they were to disclose their positions? If this is a war of ownership it just seems like it would be beneficial to all parties involved and bought-in to disclose positions, so that we look like a united front. Combine that with some other large buy from an interested party and that could be huge, right?  

After hearing about the possibility of a streaming service to compete with Twitch, I became interested in actually going long with GME. Even at $325. Not only that, but I feel like GameStop will go forward with the feeling of “we need to justify all the faith put into us.” I can’t imagine another company that would feel as much obliged to the approval of their share holders than GameStop. Can you imagine the necessity to deliver that board must feel?? They ought to.  

Just thoughts from a baby ape. It’s been fun getting involved with the sub I’m constantly hearing my boyfriend and husband talk about when they’re jerking each other off. Thanks for humoring an annoying noob. At the very least, I’ll always know that I’m not a fucking paper hands bitch. FTR, in the week since I’ve put $25k into GME, I’ve gotten another $6.5k in payments in real life. There are real life lessons to be learned from not being a paper hands bitch. I’m a better, ballsier businesswoman after this week. I love hanging out with you fucking retards and I’m looking forward to posting many future loss/gain porns which will be completely unrelated to GME. 💜💎🙌🏼

1612420350.0,377,Nokia Q4 Earning Report just released.,"The whole report can be seen [here](http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/04/2169538/0/en/Nokia-Corporation-Financial-Report-for-Q4-and-Full-Year-2020.html).

Here are the key points mentioned in the report. I will follow up with important things that I personally took note of. Overall, Nokia absolutely kicked ass in 2020 considering the economic implications of COVID, and projections for 2021 and beyond look good.

**Nokia Corporation Financial Report for Q4 and Full Year 2020**

**Solid margin performance driven by customer demand in North America**

* 5% year-on-year decrease in reported net sales in Q4, primarily due to Mobile Access, as declines in network deployment and planning services were partially offset by growth in radio access products
* 1% growth in constant currency net sales in Q4
* Continued improvements in our Mobile Access portfolio; strengthening roadmaps, reducing product costs and improving product performance; commitment to invest in R&D to drive product leadership
* Increase in Mobile Access gross margin in Q4, primarily driven by improved 5G gross margin, partially offset by a project-related loss provision
* Positive operating profit, on a reported basis, in Q4 and full year 2020
* Non-IFRS operating profit in Q4 benefited by approximately EUR 250 million, due to the timing of revenue recognition and a net positive fluctuation in Nokia’s venture fund investments
* Strong free cash flow in Q4 and full year 2020 benefited from an early customer payment of approximately EUR 0.5 billion, which was expected in Q1 2021
* Derecognized EUR 2.9 billion of Finnish deferred tax assets, which are not lost
* Reiterated outlook for 2021 comparable operating margin of 7-10% and provided new outlook for net sales and free cash flow
* Board does not propose a dividend or dividend authorization for the financial year 2020

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

My personal notes -

* Nokia kicked ass in 2020. Keep in mind that the Corona economy heavily impacted many companies this year, and infrastructure/5G development for Nokia was generally slowed down YoY; yet Nokia still met Operating Margin targets as well as growing the reach of the business overall.
* Nokia met their Operating Margin target of 7%-10% at a solid 7.2%.
* Nokia has successfully maintained and is now operating a completely independent international supply chain with 25 locations.
* Nokia has projected a Net Sales growth in 2021 as demand for 5G infrastructure will continue to grow.
* Though net sales are down, the reduction in sales is being offset by increased demand for 5G products and infrastructure.
* There were €200MM revenue that has been delayed (not lost) as a result of COVID.
* Nokia expects to take advantage of €150MM in benefits from COVID in 2021.
* Nokia management is NOT issuing a dividend this year in order to stimulate better growth and retain higher Free Cash Flow. **They project net positive growth in 2021, and would like to instate a dividend for 2021.**
* YoY EPS increase.
* QoQ EPS decrease. Nokia has stated that this is likely a result of €2.9 Billion deferred taxes being unrecognized.
* 3rd Quarter in a row with increase in Free Cash Flow.
* 2020 ended with €2.5 Billion in Free Cash Flow."
1612420163.0,81,Questions regarding GME,"Hey WSB,

I had a few questions regarding GME. Now, I'm no paper-handed bitch, but did want to open a discussion up as to a few things that have been on my mind.

1. Assuming short ladder attacks exist, what's stopping the hedge funds from just continuing to do it til we reach 0?

2. What's the point of the hedge funds doubling down on their shorts if they don't think it'll go down more? Wouldn't this actually be a BAD sign for us retail investors (gamblers, retards, apes, whatever you wanna call it)

3. How come the short squeeze (assuming it still happens) would increment the price like it did with VW? Why can't the shorts just cover their positions slowly over time?

4. How long do we realistically have to hold GME in order for a short squeeze to actually happen? I know everyone here's always saying ""oh they're paying a shit ton of interest per day, they HAVE to cover soon"". Isn't that interest rate smaller than actually paying for shares upwards of $42069 (obviously a meme number, more realistically, I'm assuming if the squeeze is to be squoze, we'd reach $1000, maybe upwards of $2000. I can't see it being much more without some HF tricks being pulled in order to prevent it from going up that high).

Mind you, I'd love to be bullish, and worst case scenario this is a year long+ hold for me, I believe Ryan Cohen definitely will be able to actually bring GameStop to a much larger market cap, and this is a much more, imo, lucrative sector than pet food/toys/whatever else. I'm sure he'll be able to expand into the tech sector as well, with Matt Francis being the new Chief Technology Officer, definitely looks like he'll be able to bring together a decent team of engineers (if you're reading this, I'm looking for a Software Engineering Internship for this summer or if any of you redditors have connections lmk...)

1612419665.0,33,Serious Question about S3 short interest data,"Let me start by saying I am not a paper handed bitch and will be holding my 10 GME shares @$128 till im both retarded AND dead. 

I am idiot and 5 beers deep but I have seen several posts from people saying that S3 had recently changed their short % float formula to hide things. 

They are referencing traditional SI % float figures and the new “S3 SI% float” figures, saying this S3 SI figure is a new or recently changed formula. But I’m looking at tweets from S3 as far back as October here where they have been mentioning the S3 SI% float this whole time based on what I’m seeing. 

https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1318313725187772419?s=21

Am I too retarded to understand this or have people been lying about the formula changing? I’m still holding either way just trying to get to the bottom of this fuck"

1612418765.0,67,S3 partners short interest miscalculation argument,"Check out u/nov81 and his post on the S3 short interest numbers before reading. Typing on mobile so excuse shitty formatting.

Essentially, the argument is that there is an old and new short interest calculation used by S3 partners which is true. I decided to look a little deeper into this an actually verify what he was saying. 

These are the two equations as per S3 partners founders Twitter:

Old - SI = shares_short / float

New - SI = shares_short / (float + shares_short)

The new equation, by adding the numerator to the base, creates a asymptote in which means it is impossible to touch 100% short interest and as a result is impossible to go above. No real issue here. 

u/nov81 claims however, that the reason for the sudden drop in share short is that whatever analyst at S3 decided to take the short interest calculated from the new equation, then use that to find # shares short from the old equation. 

This makes sense because because algebra would tell you that you cannot solve for two unknowns in an equation as simple as this, no cube roots or quadratics or whatever. This means that when we try and calculate shares short using the new equation, we get this; 

shares_short = SI * (float + shares_short) 

We cannot rearrange for shares_short using valid algebra. You could spend hours trying to, but it’s not possible. This here shows that in trying to calculate shares_short we need the shares_short variable, which is already unknown. You get the idea. His idea is that with this, an analyst then went onto use the old equation to recalculate the shares short. 

shares_short = SI * float

The issue with this, is if we substitute SI for the new equation, we get this:

shares_short = (shares_short/(float + shares short)) * float 

You see the issue? There is no way to calculate shares_short without knowing short interest, and the short interest cannot be calculated without knowing shares_short. Neither calculation is feasible, the logic is flawed. 

The day in which these shorts were covered was the day we saw the second peak in price. Most of this peak was in post market in which institutional investors have full right to buy and sell shares, and institutional investors are the one covering the shares. 

Not only this, but u/nov81 needs to explain why Ortex also showed a drop of the same size shares short? I could have easily fucked up this math and an open to anyone correcting me, but even so there is no explanation for ortex. 

Regardless, there are STILL 26M shares sold short. When we covered 26M shares there was a large price move which we may see the likes of again as we stay sitting at this $90 support. 

TL:DR; misinformation but shouldn’t matter because 50% short interest still high as fuck"
1612418553.0,1533,THEY WANT TO INVESTIGATE WSB? THE SEC ARE HYPOCRITES AND LIERS THAT ARE PROTECTING THE RICH AND POWERFUL,"From the very beginning, we knew these people weren't our friends. The SEC **VOWED** to protect retail traders, for ONCE. The media has swept this narrative under the rug, and are now happily pushing the new trend, calling for more regulation.

They have lied through their teeth.

CNBC hosts a show with Jim Cramer called MAD MONEY, where stocks are literally called left and right with little or ZERO fundamental analysis. The show itself does not provide any significant evidence to support these stock calls, but instead refers investors to THESTREET - a firm that does publish simple balance sheets of companies, then gives their 2 cents on such.  

  
They decided to investigate us rather than the CNBC pumpers/fear mongers that pushed FALSE NARRATIVES FOR CITADEL, the hedgies which shorted more shares than existed with money that doesn't exist (crippled a company for years), and brokers that openly restricted trade of certain securities for little reason (this is real market manipulation).

We will water the fountain of liberty with the tears of bears and boomers. This is not over. They will soon be running SCARED SHITLESS. Notice how Gamestop the company didn't issue more shares and dilute. They didn't dilute at $500, $300, and here we are at $90 and still nothing. With 88%+ short interest, they must really know that this valuation is low. Not a single insider share has been sold either, to my knowledge. I will personally hold until GameStop dilutes and can fix their balance sheet, I literally want to see this company healthy again. 

For the last time, THE MEDIA IS NOT OUR FRIENDS. They said we were a mob and called for more regulation at first before they realized it was popular to support us. They said we were ""gamifying"" trading. They said we were all radical right, and white supremecis. Worst of all they pushed a false narrative that we were pumping SLV, in a likely attempt to gain hype for a citadel long position, so they could liquidate and have more funds for GME covering."

1612418472.0,139,GME simple explanation,"This is very simple, for all the hype it’s easy to explain exactly what happened and what’s happening. Nikola, a company who has never produced a product and is widely believed to be outright fraud has a marker cap of ~$8.3B as of Feb 3rd, 2021. GameStop, a company with ~40k employees in the growing industry of video games has a market cap of ~$6B. A few months ago a dynamic businessman, Ryan Cohen bought millions of shares of GameStop, and then joined the board with other former Chewy executives (an online pet supply store worth ~$40B). People who had long believed GameStop has more value than the market was giving it (a low of ~$250M total market value at one point), along with new people who now saw potential in this businesses turn around, bought stock in the business. That should be the end of the story.

It’s because hedge funds on Wall Street have again been so greedy that they risked the entire United States financial system. See, these hedge funds “shorted” the stock, 140%. How can you have 140% of an entire companies stock? You can’t but they did. And the risk, which they never considered in their infinite wisdom, is infinite losses. Infinite losses? Yes, a stock price can go to $0 and the shareholders lose all their money and the company is bankrupt. But a stock has no top dollar amount, and when you’re short a stock, you bet it goes to 0, but if you’re wrong it can go as far up as any stock has ever gone for any reason. A good reason would be, the stock went up for fundamental reasons but the short positions couldn’t unwind because you can’t undo 140%, you could only undo 100%. Therefore, in using market manipulation to drive a company into bankruptcy they were suddenly faced with infinite losses, something that would send catastrophic ripples through the financial industry.

So, Robinhood. We all thought they were cool but like Facebook they’re fucking evil because they’re free, so instead of paying $6 a trade we pay $0, which was cool until last week when we found out that in spite of their name Robinhood, they are actually in the business of selling financial data to hedge funds. They take your trade order, and let the hedge funds know so their High Frequency Trading can arbitrage pennies on every trade by “beating” it to the order, millions of times a day. Ok, fuck us millennials, ok yeah but also, a little consumer protection, maybe? Ok - this is where it gets fucked.

What we learned Thursday is that Wall Street and the stock brokers do not have America’s interest their interest is to hedge funds and banks. Trading was restricted, whether it was Robinhood, the brokers, the Market Makers, we may never know but it’s not that important because it reveals that the system is fundamentally and structurally aligned to protect the few existing billionaires against Americans interest. This is a fatal sin against our democratic capitalism and risks everything we stand to be.

Moreover, they did it for a reason, the same people that control our stock markets, the barons of our nations wealth, also risked destroying them with infinite losses. How do you cover -140% to infinity? This would alter the value of every equity in America, so they shut it down.

Now, as we try to piece this together, one wrong is repairing the damage done to individual investors but the bigger change needs to be structural, prosecuting the criminals we allow to run our economy and rebuilding an equitable market to allow the American dream to prosper.

1612418161.0,129,The Real Value Behind GME (In-Depth DD),"LEGITIMATE ARGUMENT TO INVEST IN GME AT THESE PRICES (Short sqeeze and hype aren't reasons).

Sherman started a turnaround of Gamestop when he first took over April 2019. He cut the dividend, began consolidation (cut some fatty stores), and began debt reduction. COVID threw a wrench in this because he didn't move online nearly fast enough.

When Burry first invested in GME, there was a reason. What reason? He spoke with Sherman about his plans. Cohen also had a similar situation, and later of course he got involved. Sherman listens to both, and in their letters to him they basically tell him where he fucked up and how to move Gamestop forward.

Next up we see the Microsoft deal. Although exact numbers aren't available that I can find, Gamestop will be receiving a royalty from gaming equipment sold via Microsoft. Microsoft is also expanding Gamestop's inventory on the inside and employees will use Microsoft software to run the stores. Microsoft doesn't want Gamestop to fail, nor will they let them. With 27% of new games bought at Gamestop and 40% of used games bought there, Microsoft saw an excellent way to try and compete this console cycle.

We recently saw Gamestop's holiday earnings. With a yearly revenue of roughly $7 bil, they were unprofitable this year. However, this is expected to change with earnings starting in March. They are expected to continue to be profitable moving forward as well. Gamestop still has roughly $500 mil in debt. How are they going to pay this off!!!??? Liquidating stores and consolidation. This was a Cohen continuation idea that Sherman had started, just without the vision to make it succeed. A small stock offering (let's say 2%) would also leave them in an excellent financial situation. Additionally, we have the 300% YOY online sales increase, which accounted for over 30% of total sales. This is only expected to increase moving forward. While overall sales decreased by 3% YOY, inefficient stores were cut out of the picture. Comparative store sales increased by 5% YOY, but this was even stagnated due to state restrictions on 'nonessential' businesses. Places that had significantly fewer COVID numbers had over 30% YOY growth.

Next, we have the Chewy powerhouses joining the board of directors. Out with the old, in with the new. Even though most directors were acquired in 2020, these new additions add incredible value to the company. Sherman listens to Cohen. Cohen and friends had some focuses at Chewy that led to insane amounts of profit. They focused on cutting costs and maximizing efficiency. Expect the same for Gamestop. This was something that can be effectively implemented with all the new leadership. All ears are on Cohen and his ideas to make Gamestop a 1 stop gaming shop.

Most recently were the adds today. Francis: That AWS engineering guy that's now heading technology!? Nice. Durkin: Customer service VP from Chewy is now in charge of Gamestop's customer service!? Fuck yes Chewy has insanely good customer service. Krueger: Big filler boi from Amazon et all now running e-commerce fulfillment!? Dope.

Tldr: Idc about a squeeze or hype but I like the stock.

Based on what I have researched, this is a strong buy. The pet care market was 223.1 BN in 2019 and is expected to grow to 327.7 BN by 2026. Adding on top of that they are coming out with Truforma (in March of 2021)  a diagnostic platform that uses disposable assay cartridges to provide rapid in-office testing of whole blood, serum, and plasma. It can detect Thyroid disease in dogs and cats, and adrenal disease in dogs. They are also developing Gastrointestinal testing for Truforma too along with other diseases. 

Based on the company's low marketcap at 945.m (which has basically 5x in the last two months) they have a lot of room to grow to capture even 20 BN of the global pet care market. That would put there stock valuation somewhere in $20-$25 range. I believe it will be $3-7 within this year."

I wish you all the best, and it is the biggest trading mistake of my life so far.  I was talking about GME with my friends in March 2020, and even did trade some options then for a loss.  I must have read DFV at some point, as we were discussing Burry and a ""technical short squeeze"" happening.  But I missed the real boat, so good on DFV and all of the rest of you degenerates.  

Instead, I focused my market attention during quarantine on precious metals.  My opinion is that in the long term (10+ years) they will provide the only real hedge against inflation in the world as every CB on the planet is exploding the supply of fiat to deal with COVID economic disruption.  

In the short term, I believe that the ""powers that be"" are engineering the largest short squeeze in the history of markets.  We do not have the power to effect whether this happens, it is simply an inevitability.  HFs, banks, and other large institutions are going to extract an enormous amount of wealth from the world during this squeeze.

The last few months aside, I never saw WSB as a force for societal change, because the people who control the money are always going to win the most in the end.  WSB is a place where we can learn the tricks of a market that is structurally rigged against us, and use those tricks to our advantage.  To use an analogy that I think we all know: I am not, and will never be, Ender.  But I can learn that the Enemy's Gate is Down, and play The Game that way.


**The tl;dr is this: the market for silver is the most manipulated physical market in the history of the world.  $SLV is the vehicle that is currently being used behind the scenes to vaccum up ownership of every available physical bar of silver in major bullion vaults in the world.  When it has completed doing that, the ""paper"" markets that have held down the price of silver for decades will become disconnected from the physical markets.  The energy that has been artificially held back for decades by this paper will explode the price of physical silver, and I have no idea how high it will go.  $SLV will stand (mostly) alone as the world's exchange traded product for electronic trading of physical silver.**



# LET'S START AT THE BEGINNING: WHY IS SILVER IMPORTANT?

Silver has been used as real currency for thousands of years, and there is an argument to be made for returning to ""sound"" money through the use of silver and gold.  However, that is not the argument that I am making.

Silver is a highly industrial metal, and it's usage for industry will only continue to expand as we electrify the future.  Silver is important for electrical applications b/c it is the most-conductive / least-resistive metal in the universe (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_and_conductivity#Resistivity_and_conductivity_of_various_materials).  It is used heavily in all electronic applications (even more since RoHS has pushed us away from Tin/Lead and towards Tin/Silver solder blends, with silver being added to mitigate the longevity problems of 100% Tin solder growing Tin whiskers and shorting out components).  But the largest new demands on silver are going to come from solar panels and EVs.  Utility-scale solar is now virtually tied with wind as the cheapest new sources of energy in the world and is only getting cheaper every year.  As fossil fuel plants continue to reach the end of their service life, they are going to be replaced with solar and wind technologies.  As EVs become more prevalent, their components (ESPECIALLY their batteries) will produce additional demand for Silver.

As smart investors are wont to do, this coming demand for industrial silver has been front-run and large quantites of silver have been sucked into investment products so that they can produce financial returns when demand begins to increase.  2020 showed remarkable investor interest in silver, to the tune of an estimated 350Mtoz moving into exchange traded products like $SLV.  $SLV alone added ~200Mtoz of silver to it's holdings in 2020.

Unfortunately for the market, supply cannot meet demand: Of the 930.9Mtoz estimated for 2020 demand, only 236Mtoz was available for physical investment, because the rest was consumed by industrial uses.  This means that $SLV alone absorbed almost the entire world's capacity for silver investment in 2020, and as you'll see soon, this is only accelerating in 2021.

# LETS GET PHYSICAL, PHYSICAL

Now it's important to understand that huge amounts of ""silver"" is traded on ""paper"" markets, and these markets have historically decided the approximate cost of physical silver in the world, in the form of the ""spot price"".  I'm not going to give anyone a primer on how this works, go read about the London Fix and COMEX paper on your own time.  But the important thing to know is that there are a bunch of silver bars in vaults in London and in the U.S., and electronic claims on them are traded on the LBMA and COMEX continuously, without the silver ever leaving the vaults.  

However, these vaults have concrete numbers of physical bars in them, and trading contracts against them technically means that you can show up at a window somewhere and demand your 5x 1000oz bars that a COMEX warrant entitle you to.  This redemption happens all the time, and it can be used to extract physical silver from the unallocated storage at bullion vaults and release it to industrial or consumer bullion uses.  However, these bars can also be moved into ""registered"" or ""allocated"" accounts without them leaving the overall vault storage.  This means that a quantity of individual silver bars that an owner holds title to can be physically moved inside the vault onto a different rack, and the owner has individual serial numbers of bars that they own.  These bars can be withdrawn on demand only by their owner and are not available for general redemption of a COMEX warrant.

So how many bars are there? Well between LBMA and COMEX, there are 1480.3Mtoz sitting in vaults (sources below when I start doing math).  This includes all allocated AND unallocated bars.  Now, obviously London and NY are separated by an ocean, but people always like to bring up that bars could be moved b/w London <-> American COMEX vaults.  This is an enormous undertaking, but let's make a ""spherical chicken in a vaccuum"" level assumption and say that LBMA + COMEX vaults are a singular source of inventory for both $SLV and other market participants.

If you read the $SLV S-1 (which I did: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1330568/000119312505127244/ds1.htm) you would learn that the custodian of the $SLV trust is required to hold all silver weight (with an exception for 1100toz of unallocated, lol) that is owned by the trust in allocated accounts, where the individual bars are physically segregated inside the vaults, and the serial numbers of the owned bars are explicitly recorded.  The idea that there is ""no physical silver"" backing the SLV trust and ""you could get settled with cash"" is _ridiculous_.  iShares publishes a report listing every serial number of every bar that is owned by the trust, along with the total weight contained in the bars.  It is 10847 pages long (you can read it here if you have trouble sleeping at night: https://emea-markets.jpmorgan.com/metalicsWebAppJanus/publicUnauthenticated/BONY_SLV.pdf) and is updated frequently.

The underlying silver is _owned_ by the trust.  It cannot be removed from the trust unless ""baskets"" of 50000 shares are redeemed by an ""Authorized Participant"" which is only a few large brokers.  It cannot be removed by the bullion vaults and given to other customers because it is physically segregated inside the vaults.

People who have recently beaten down the idea of a silver squeeze love to talk about how JP Morgan is the custodian for the SLV trust.  And because JPM just paid a $1B fine for historical manipulation of the paper silver market, they aren't going to be honest about this.  This is crazy talk.

When it comes to the dishonesty of a big bank, there is ""fraud"" and there is FRAUD.  ""Fraud"" would be them saying ""Oh sorry, we didn't realize that a laundromat bringing in $300k/week of dirty dollar bills was out of the ordinary"". ""Fraud"" happens all the time, and the banks get away with it regularly.  FRAUD would be them saying ""Oh yes, 3rd party customer (iShares) who services dozens of other large banking institutions in the world, here is objective evidence, with serial numbers, that we have these silver bars in the vault"" and then just making up the data.  It is QANON-level crazy, IMHO, to think that JPM is going to commit FRAUD by publishing a list of serial numbers that is completely fake.  

I believe the exact opposite: since they _have_ just gotten caught, they are playing it straight this time and have just switched sides in order to go long.  On the COMEX alone, JP Morgan Chase is long 193.9Mtoz, or just north of $5B.

The problem for the futures and options markets is that their continual trading of paper contracts is chasing a smaller and smaller amount of physical silver that is not owned by $SLV.  And the market participants (minus, now, JPM) who have gotten away with naked selling of paper contracts and mostly settling them for cash are going to soon find the underlying vaults empty and no metal to give to warrant holders who come looking for it.



# HOW BIG OF A PROBLEM IS $SLV FOR THE NAKED SHORTS IN THE PAPER MARKET? LET'S DO SOME MATH.

$SLV inventory math:

$SLV is holding 669,357,789.40 troy ounces in trust, and has 720,500,000 shares outstanding.  

(If you are curious why $SLV/share trades below the spot price, it's because: 669.4Mtoz / 720.5M shares = .929 toz / share)

($SLV data from here: https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239855/ishares-silver-trust-fund?qt=SLV#/ )

(screenshot from tonight for posterity: https://imgur.com/a/0sqcMFr)


Bullion vault inventory math:

London (LBMA) silver stocks are 1080.5Mtoz (http://www.lbma.org.uk/london-precious-metals-physical-holdings-statistics)

US COMEX silver stocks are 399.8Mtoz (https://www.cmegroup.com/delivery_reports/Silver_stocks.xls)

669.4/(1080.5 + 399.8) = 45.2% of the vaulted silver in the world is already owned by SLV

Subtracting what SLV already owns, leaves us with: (1080.5 + 399.8) - 669.4 = 810.9Mtoz

(This is _completely_ ignoring the fact that a lot of that remaining silver is owned in registered or allocated accounts by individual owners.  E.g. there is 150.2Mtoz in ""registered"" on the COMEX which means those bars are already specifically deeded to an individual owner. But they could theoretically sell it to SLV so I included it as available.)

810.9Mtoz is the ABSOLUTE THEORETICAL MAXIMUM available in LBMA + COMEX silver that is not _already_ owned by SLV.


Now how short are the shorts?  Some more math:

OI on COMEX futures: https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/precious/silver-futures-and-options.html

    + 179786*5000toz
    + 130402*5000toz 
    +   8245*1000toz
    +   1903*2500toz
    ----------------
    1,563,942,500 = 1563.9Mtoz 
in currently open interest that could be demanded for delivery.  Just on the COMEX, there could be demand for twice as much silver as there is in the combined LBMA + COMEX vaults that is not explicitly owned by $SLV right now.  

Caveats: 

- I have not included any London futures contracts that may have claims on metal here.  I am not versed in their contracts at all and don't have a good data source right now.  If anyone knows how to calculate the short obligation for London I would be glad to add it.

- I have not analyzed any of the strike prices on COMEX options or dates on COMEX futures...some of them could be way out of the money or way in the future.  Many silver producers sell futures years in advance to lock in prices, and then deliver the physical to satisfy the contracts.

Using the same basic methodology–total shorts divided by shares [toz in this case] outstanding–as is used on a stock to calculate short interest (and gave us the infamous 140% short interest on GME) we get......drumroll please:

1563.9 short / 810.9 physical = 192.9% short interest.

**OPEN INTEREST ON COMEX SILVER FUTURES AND OPTIONS IS EQUIVALENT TO A 192.9% SHORT INTEREST AGAINST ALL LONDON AND U.S. AVAILABLE INVENTORY.**  

But it gets even worse.





# WANNA ADD A GAMMA SQUEEZE??

I pulled the data for all current OI in SLV options.  There is a large number (5.7 million) of call contracts open (here are the totals: https://imgur.com/tiqPA34)

Using the .929toz/share number, we can calculate that there are up to 527.2Mtoz that would have to be bought during an absolute runaway Gamma Squeeze.  Call options on $SLV max out right now at $55, so the spot price would only have to increase by around 122% to reach the point that all of that weight would need to have been purchased.  But at some point, it could become self-reinforcing, and the gamma squeeze continues to cause more gamma squeezing.  

I believe that this almost happened Sunday evening (2021-01-31) as evidenced by the huge premium that $SLV was trading to the futures price for a few minutes when trading opened.  (My comparison chart: https://i.imgur.com/UPjL3zm.png) 

The Silver ETF that trades on Sunday in Tel Aviv (https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TCHF82:IT) closed up >6% (and was consistenly rising for the entire session) before any american spot markets opened.  I believe that hedging algorithms at MM firms that write options saw this spike as a need to buy shares in $SLV to cover their deltas, and so they bought the opening of $SLV like crazy.  $SLV opened up 17.6%, while paper only opened up about 6%.  Paper market players had to sell 23.8Mtoz of paper in the first minute of trading to keep the price under control.  I have never seen an imbalance like this before, and it was covered up quickly (within 2 hours of trading).  But to me, it sounds like Vincent's heartbeat monitor in GATTACA when he runs out of fake signal: there was a cover up required to hide this explosion.

When the day comes that this cover up is not executed properly, stuff is going to get ugly, b/c $SLV won't just gamma squeeze like a normal stock...



# BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE! A TRADITIONAL GAMMA/SHORT SQUEEZE WILL SEEM LIKE NOTHING IN SILVER

The squeeze in silver will be FAR WORSE than the combination of a gamma and short squeeze in a stock, because shares of stock cannot be removed from the market.  Eventually somebody holding $VW or $GME is going to say ""sure, I'll sell at $42,000.69 per share"" and that share can go back to cover a short.  But if instead of doing that, the holder of that share withdrew it from the market by converting it to a physical token b/c they thought that the physical token would be more valuable than the share (the retail premium on physical silver vs. paper silver), the short interest would INCREASE as shares were converted into tokens.  And since there are currently more ""shares"" of silver than there are bars of silver in the vault, the shorts can be caught with a literally illiquid market that has nothing to buy.

Zero.  Zilch.  No silver available.

The doomsday scenario (for paper silver holders and writers) is the following combination:

- holders of COMEX warrants will see the rising premium of physical bullion to the spot price and decide to redeem their warrants for physical 

- a rising spot price will Gamma Squeeze the writers of $SLV options into buying more shares in a runaway fashion and the trust will absorb all available vault inventory as it issues new shares

COMEX warrant holders who try to demand metal that doesn't exist will literally break the market.  

The CBOE will probably step in and decide to force settle the contracts for cash at the last known good price, and **COMEX paper warrants will cease trading forever.**

The physical market price will then be disconnected from the paper market, and $SLV as an exchange traded product will stand (mostly) alone as the new ""paper"" market for silver.




# SO WTF DO I DO? [NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE]

Well I could always buy physical silver, if I can stomach the premium and wait 8 weeks for it to show up.  Or, I could just get long on $SLV.  Since I believe that $SLV will stand alone after the dust settles as the one true claim on bars in the vaults, I could be long the actual $SLV ticker in several ways:

- Buying shares (duh, but it worked for $GME)

- Buying long dated calls (Gamma Squeeze go BRRRRR, but who knows when)

- Buying option spreads (my personal favorite)

If I wanted to maximize my contribution to the Gamma Squeeze, I'd probably buy as much Delta/$ as I could get using weeklies, which would be 2/5 $26.5C or 2/12 $28C 

(Max delta/$ calculations: https://i.imgur.com/Az3o85v.png and https://i.imgur.com/eRPQo6k.png)

Current open positions for me are: (https://imgur.com/vWZrziG)

- Jan'22 50/55 call spread (costs .17, moonshot pays $5, 29x)

- 4/16 40/55 call spread (costs .18, moonshot pays $15, 83x)

- 2/5 $26.5 call (to maximize delta/$)

- jan'22 $40 call (to minimize risk of missing the big one)

- $AG shares and jan'23 10/35 call spread (added, sorry i forgot this one: https://imgur.com/fz80V6J)

On Friday the pattern will tighten up and we'll likely see either $GME fall to oblivion or a big ass spike by Monday. IDK if the spike will be the squeeze, but It'll be big. The number of [Puts expiring and past volume](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbavu0/the_ratio_of_short_volume_to_total_volume/) supports this theory and [Robinhood increased allowed share purchases to $500](https://www.forexlive.com/news/!/robinhood-increases-limits-in-buying-gme-to-500-shares-20210204) which should make it possible for more apes to buy the dip and drive the squeeze.

Everyone - first of all - just understand that stocks don’t actually only go up.  They can go down too.  And guess what?  Unlike cryptocurrency you can buy these things called PUTS which allow you to make money when a stock goes DOWN. 

So here is the plan:

1.  Sell all your shares and calls.  

Why?  the upward momentum was killed..  look at your fucking chart you stupid dumbfucking retard.


———————

2.  We create DOWNWARD MOMENTUM AND SELLING PRESSURE from SELLING! 

Why?  You will stop losing money, and just lock in whatever you have left.  

Why?  Because we are going to re-invest ourselves into a NEW OPPORTUNITY.  

Once everyone has stopped being stupid and minimized their never ending loss ..  the stock will just PLUMMET instead of this retarded FLAT movement that makes no money for anyone.

3.  We invest everything into DEEP OTM PUTS expiring this Week or Next Week expiration - 

If we made the stock go up we can make it go down - AND PROFIT!!

So SELL YOUR SHIT

AND BUY PUTS SO WE ALL MAKE MOON MONEY!

1612417392.0,2020,DO NOT SELL. Why GME is going to $1000 next week!,"First of all if you are reading this post and do not own any GME stock, go and buy some right now. Ok, now that that is taken care of, I have done some thinking and have discovered some interesting things. I will list 3 reasons why GME is not over, and why this is actually going to shoot to new records this week or next week. 

TLDR: GME is going to 800-1000 by next week because all the bitch paper handers are out, there is also a possibility of a second short squeeze happening any day now

&#x200B;

* The other day when GME fell 60%, the volume for that day did not even pass the average daily volume. Yes let me repeat that, when the stock went down 60%, there was so little amount of sellers, we did not even pass the daily volume. This means that the people who are paper hand bitches have already sold, because if GME goes down 60% and you haven't sold, good news for you, you are a diamond hand baller. Now this leads to my second point.

&#x200B;

* So that the only people left holding GME are the diamond hand chads, it will be really hard to get us to sell. If anything this dip has been a blessing to allow us to grab more stock at cheap. We have held the ground of around $100 or a good 2 days. If you do not know, GME was way below that at the beginning of its new found value. The short percentage is still super high, even though the old shorts may be out, there are now new shorts that think this thing is going back down. But once they realize that won't happen, they will stop risking it and just buy back the stock. Now this is what can kickstart the next short squeeze which I think can easily go to 800-1000

&#x200B;

* Now if those two reasons weren't good enough. Gamestop has hired new executives and professionals to the company from very successful companies. This means that they are not letting this opportunity go to waste and make some money from it. And remember, a company is worth however much the people who buy the stock believe it is worth at."

I still have GME and am hoping it does go up again so I can get out as fast as I can, because I was in the green and sold twice but bought back in when I knew it was a bad play. Did it anyway just because of the rhetoric. 

Don’t be like me. Get the fuck out and stay out if you’re not already in up to your eyeballs in these worthless meme stocks.

I have not been part of this community for very long but I am quite invested in what it is now standing for and I have backed that with my own capital as much as I am able to. 

Today everything seemed to be much more United and positive in the community as well...until we held the line, big dog officers were hired by GME, and DFV reaffirmed his presence......

When things began to look better and we started celebrating the close with “just” a couple percent above opening, the posts and comments noticeably began to become much more befuddled with doubtful, argumentative and aggressive rhetoric and disinformation.

Q4 Results:

* Revenue was $2.9 billion, up 28% on both an as-reported basis and a foreign exchange (FX) neutral basis.
* Gross merchandise volume (GMV) was $26.6 billion, up 21% on an as-reported basis and up 18% on an FX-Neutral basis.
* Annual active buyers grew by 7%, for a total of 185 million global active buyers.
* Dividends increased by 13% to $0.18/quarter.

Other Information:

* Expanded share repurchases by an additional $4.0 billion.
* Promoted Listings yielded over $215 million of revenue in Q4, up 60% on an as-reported basis.
* Annual Ad revenue surpassed $1 billion for the year.
* Authenticity Service support for watches/sneakers - resulting 2-3x GMV growth in respective categories.
* Continued expansion of Managed Payments, i.e. other options besides PayPal.
* Raised $123 million in charity donations. (Potentially supporting some of the autists in this sub).
* On earnings call, talked about leveraging influencers and TikTok to partially drive sales/ user growth on the platform.

There was also an Ebay app notification sent out mid afternoon, as someone else [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb3485/what_is_ebay_trying_to_tell_me/) also pointed out, which some retards could possibly interpret as ""hold"" because it's going ""up"" at least ""15%"". However, Cramer told a caller tonight that it's a buy, and inverse Cramer is usually the play.

In addition, of Ebay's last 67 quarterly reports, on periods where it closed with a gain after hours - the following day closed higher 22/33 (67%) of the time.

Interested to see where people think this is going post earnings near/long term, if anywhere. Ebay gets a lot of hate but I am personally holding shares and various calls. Finally might get back some of those seller fees."

The change in my perception is especially obvious when watching the amateur videos.

It's very odd realising that I am bigger than practicality all the dicks I see.

I simply cannot understand how I never realised this before.

>Rule 203(b)(3) applies to fails to deliver in threshold securities if the participant’s fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days. Although as a result of compliance with Rule 204, generally a participant’s fail to deliver positions will not remain for 13 consecutive settlement days, if, for whatever reason, a participant of a registered clearing agency has a fail to deliver position at a registered clearing agency in a threshold security for 13 consecutive settlement days, the requirement to close-out such position under Rule 203(b)(3) remains in effect.

Edit: 
Just to clarify, what does ""required to close-out"" really mean - legally?  They have to start buying during regular trading hours?  They have to close BY the end of the 13th day?

1612414901.0,40,How I think this will all play out,"My Prediction:
Diamond hands, GME, and HFers will come out of this okay, at the expense of paperhands and non WSB retail investors. How will this play out? WSB retailers are now wise to the game: HF and MMs control the price of the stock and the mainstream media. This time, we are in control of the shares. HFs need those shares, but diamond hands aren’t giving them up. So how do the HF’s get them back? By making average cnbnc viewers buy them. But how?

Massive short laddering and FUD campaigns are an obvious ploy at shaking out any paper porn toys they can find. Every paperhand folding now is a cheaper share they need to buy back. Anyone left with skin in the game is gonna be hard to shake off, but HFers aren’t gonna just pay up. How will they get the average retailer to pay up?

There are a massive amount of 3/19 800$ calls that have been purchased. HFers will use this to recover some of their money. One day, between 2/5 and 3/19, GME price will skyrocket from 90-100$ all the way up to 500$, as HFers cover their shorts. Some of us will cash out our investments, and leave a few shares to speculate, others will fully cash out. CNBC and CNN will be screaming from their platforms that the short squeeze has begun, and everyone should pile in and get those sweet gainz. Average retailers will pile on, driving the price up to somewhere between 500-1000. Then, the HFers will ladder the stock down to 100, shaking down new paperhanders for cheap shares. They’ll leave it back at 100 for a few days to see if any other paperhanders walk off. CNN/CNBC will help drive off investor confidence with FUD campaigns. Rinse and repeat. Eventually, HFers will get the shares they need by buying these shares up on the cheap from paperhanding retailers trying to get in on the squeeze, not knowing that HFers and MMs can artificially control the price of the stock through a combination of short laddering and short buybacks. Combined with the 2/5 puts, the 3/19 calls, and the massive swings in price that the HFers can control, they will make all of their money back.

Final outcomes? Diamond hands will make big gains. No way are we getting back in at 500 if we know they can short ladder down to 100. Average retailers will come in and buy shares from diamond hands for 1000$ hoping it will go to 2000$ the next day, only to paperhand them to HFers for 100$. New retailers will flock to WSB to see the massive gains as folks cash out, get greedy, buy in, only to get slaughtered the next day. WSB will be filled with gain and loss porn. GME will come out as a multibillion dollar company with a share value from 100-300, with strong investor confidence. CNBC and CNN will hail WSB as a hallmark moment for the little man that saved GME and will change the game forever.

WSBers will forget about the short ladder attacks, the FUD campaigns, the trade freezing, etc., because hey, we made money right? Anyone who bought in at 500 and held on for dear life will have a chance of getting out. Hell, WSBers will be laughing at the average retail investor that gets slaughtered, because they should have known better, right? A few hedge funds will walk out making massive gains, a few hedge funds will implode, and nothing on wall street will change, except they’ll start taking WSB a lot more seriously. The average retail investor will continue to get screwed by wall street because they don’t know that wall street controls the pricing on stocks.

Recap. 

•Melvin/hedge funds short GameStop. Twice. 

•Xbox/Microsoft GM becomes acting GME CEO- 

•Chewy founder CEO buys in/submits prospectus to Board regarding GME transformation Microsoft/GameStop collaboration is announced

•➡️ *it was held back that they get revenue from partnership with Xbox game pass* ⬅️•

Now-we also have Elon and Mark weighing 
 in with expert advice (hey-I’m not a millionaire so they know more than me) 

And add in the market crashing, silver spambots, margins canceled, social media shut downs and all of a sudden limit buying in shares the day after all time highs. 

Very. Suspicious. To say the least. 

next?  

We know what’s next. 

GME magically recovers as the darling of Wall Street while we got manipulated again. 

But. The story takes a turn. Billboards start appearing across the country. Melvin can’t take a drive to the local Wendy’s anymore without seeing “GME to the moon”. Finland buys in. Saudia Arabia buys in. Japan buys in. The mother f@cking Times Square has GME to the moon lit up for the world to see. 

This is uncharted territory here folks. I know what Wall Street wants to happen. The media is pumping it right now. They have DFV in their beady sights. They want to see us fall. Again. 
But. It’s a new world. 2008 and the VW short squeeze didn’t have Twitter. 2008 didn’t have an army of the working class sitting at their computers figuring out that Wall Street is not the God like money figure we have been told to be believe. The reality is that the Hedge Funds that “protect” peoples retirement are really just going off of insider knowledge and the ability to manipulate the market in mass. 

It’s not 2008 anymore. I think the world has it right and they see that WSB/DFV made a damn wise call. They are the ones trying to hold the share price up every day facing down the hedge funds with sheer determination to be validated and paid. 

What they have attempted to do is criminal. It’s not 2008. 
The world is legitimately watching and showing support in this in a way I don’t think anybody expected. Especially in 2021. 

I’m holding. I don’t want to. This isn’t an example of my normal trading-having every single trick used against you.. to the point that it’s simply pure lunacy that we are witnessing.

To actually want to question a member of WSB for market manipulation. Seriously.

I cannot in good faith sell and leave everyone standing alone trying to do the right thing. Ive already lost the money. 
My retail money did the DD. They just cheated.

Adding-I am a simple monkey and do not give stock advice."

They have smart people, they have access to more data, much more capital, and they know how this works. The next two weeks should paint a pretty clear picture and I think those holding are in a better spot than they think.

This is not financial advise"
1612414115.0,24,GME and why do we matter,"I  fling poop and drag my knuckles on the floor.  I am not a financial  advisor.  Do your own due diligence.  This is for entertainment purposes  only.

Lately,  I've felt like we don't have a voice and don't matter but I want to  remind all us apes that we are retarded together.  We will win TOGETHER  and we will HOLD together.  Could be days, weeks, or months.  Longer  than any of our attention spans.  So they will use TIME against us.  BUT  time is on our side.

This is  psychological warfare against us to make us DOUBT ourselves and what we  WILL accomplish.  We will remain retarded longer then they can remain  solvent.  They bleed interest each day.  A stock's value is based upon  what we place on it.  See TSLA for reference.  WE LIKE THE FUCKING  STOCK.  If my stock is worth 5k to me, I WILL HOLD for 5 fucking K.  WHO  are you to tell us how to perceive VALUE?  OHHHHH, you're an expert who  got caught with your dick in the cookie jar (thx louis rossman).   SHORTING 130-140% of a stock.  These hedgies aren't infallible.  Just  well connected and well resourced.  As long as we own shares that they  NEED, we have time on our side.  Even though it will not feel like it.

Obligatory, don't invest what you can't lose.

We  cannot let the hedgies deter us.  Now that GME is the dinner  conversation topic of the world, everyone and their moms have an  opinion.  We will be told we don't matter.  We don't know what we are  doing(probably true. I got into stocks 2 weeks ago).  We should have  sold at the peak.  We should have bought lower.  We shouldn't have  gambled.  What people are forgetting is what WE are trying, is to do  better, and be better.  Why kick a guy down when he wants a better  fucking life.  FUCK YOU.

LOOK AT  THE PPL SPENDING THEIR TENDIES TO GIVE BACK.  It's our $, let us do what  we want with it.  If a hedgie can irresponsibly short a stock over  100%, why can't we take a CALCULATED risk?  BUUUT funDamentAls.   Gamestop is a dying company.  The former business model of GME is dying.   As most physical businesses are.  See 24 hour fitness.  (I've never  been inside a gym but I read stuff online)  But GME is pivoting.  PAPA  COWEN and the new board members are pivoting to e-commerce.  He's  assembling the fucking avengers to the END GAME but this is just getting  started.  GME is transforming just like Netflix when it went from DVDs  to online streaming.  We are the ugly duckling that gets super sexy  after growing pains.

How about  this for fuuunDamentAls.  Hedge funds being allowed to short a stock  over 100% and nobody comments on how that happened.  Why it happened.   And how SHORTING has INFINITE room to lose.  Keep in mind, they are  sophisticated gamblers with other people's money and 401ks.  BUT  according to their calculation it's little to no risk.  Because they can  throw more $ at the problem and manipulate the market, they can fix it!   If they can't, they want to cry to the media, get the public opinion  on their side, and ask for MORE GOVERNMENT REGULATION.  Why would a  greedy $ machine ask for more oversight?  OH, that's because the SEC is  your lapdog and the government will bail you out with tax payer dollars.   SEE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS.  Yet, we are not allowed to exploit the law  of supply and demand.  If the demand exceeds 100% of the supply, the  inherit value ROCKETS.  See RTX cards and AMD chips.  FUCK SCALPERS for  good measure :)

I want to remind  every single one of you, we do matter.  We have NUMBERS on our side.  As  a collective we've already made shorting a topic of conversation at the  political level.  This may not be a monetary victory but it hopefully  is a step in the right direction to a more equal game.  That or hold  your politicians accountable.  You are their constituents.

We  play out in the open.  We share publicly available information and make  decisions base.  Really, it's just autistic people posting the exact  confirmation biases that we needed to see.  It prints $$$$ BRRrrrrr.

Let's recap how the odds are stacked against us.

\-We  are too stupid to be allowed to spend our money.  We need government  intervention to ""protect us"".  The little guys, the plebes, the  unsophisticated, etc..  Yet they can't decide on how/when to get a  stimmy check to us.  THEY REALLY REALLY CARE (when hedge funds lose  money).  We some how took wallstreet down with $600.  If the stock  market was that fragile, we have BIGGER issues.

\-Momentum  was killed last week by brokers being held to new collateral  requirements by clearing houses.  Thus restricting stock purchasing with  CASH for specific securities for RETAIL investors.  This is how Phil  Jackson uses timeouts to kill momentum for the other team when they're  running HOT.  BUT Hedge Funds were still allowed to trade.  We were  allowed to sell but NOT buy.  How would NBA games look like if only one  team played while the other team sat on the bench during a timeout?  Fair?  Keep in mind, these brokers were INFORMED pre-market and didn't  have any press conferences until after market close for damage control.   Guess who also informed besides the brokers, YOUUUU SMAAHT, the  hedgies.  Seems legit.

\-News outlet and controlling the narrative.  How many analysts, journalist, and their rich ~~daddies~~  overlords are framing this as WSB pumping and dumping a meme stock.  WE  JUST LIKE THE FUCKING STOCK.  What about the narrative that WSB saved  some business that we would like to keep around post-covid.  FFS you  want to take away the movies and games?  What do you want us to do for  fun?  You deplorable sacks of shit who get no enjoyment out of life  other than sucking the souls and money out of people.  You live to see  more zeros in your account and there is a special place in hell for you.

\-SEC  holding a meeting tonight investigating market manipulation through  social media but no investigative statement on how clearing houses can  magically conjure a rule that halts trading for retail investors.   Robinhood is not the bad guy.  Many trading platforms restricted  trading.  RH is the household name that is the scapegoat.  Get the  fucking clearing house on the line and ask why they increased collateral  from 1-2% to 100 fucking percent on these specific stocks.  OHhhh,  they're not regulated but they want to invoke the SEC to regulate the  retail investors.... NICE.

\-How  shorts magically covered their positions but DO NOT have to report their  positions until weeks later.  Lack of immediate transparency gives them  ample time to reposition and multiple options to cover their asses  while blaming us.

Anyways, I could  keep bitching but I just wanted to vent and rally us together.  We took  a mad beating. I just wanted to let you beautiful online strangers that  you aren't alone.  GME has transcended and has evolved into a movement.

What  does GME mean to me?  A down-payment to a home for my family and I.  My  wife and I are expecting our first kid.  I'm risking something I can  lose... for a better future.

What does GME mean to you?

TLDR; We fucking matter.  We are going to be the catalyst of change. HOLD SHARES. Don't risk what you can't lose. APE Strong. 🦍💪💎👐  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"

Real shit, thank you to the mods. (The real ones)  I'm incredibly green to this sub, investing and Reddit in general; and from the start I was blown away at how effortlessly the mods performed this hypnotic dance along the line of diligent professional/vile heathen. Outfuckingstanding... At the same time, I instantly fell in love with the roasting, bashing and self deprecating humor that absolutely envelops this sub. As a Marine vet and firefighter with 10+ years in the service, I assure you, your shit talking is top fucking tier. The first time scrolling through this sub, I could feel my eyes watering up as I asked myself, ""Where have you beautiful bastards been all my life??"" (Just kidding, I cant read) I've only read a handful of accounts about what this group used to be and we all know it is forever changed, but I hope you apes manage to hold onto this amazing clusterfuck you've created. I hope to see it return to some level of normalcy or something greater some day, cause I AIN'T FUCKIN LEAVIN!!!

I'm still praying Tom Brady throws DFVs golden cock into the endzone tomorrow at market open or whatever it is that needs to happen, but for now; I'll take the L. I'll hold the bag. Because I gambled with money I could afford to lose. I couldn't count how many times I saw members warn people not to invest more than you can afford to lose and yet here we are, with people penniless (allegedly) and in absolute shock that this crazy idea didn't pan out (yet 😉) Worst case scenario, I paid for a crash course in capitalism. I basically have a business degree from a community college now. What a wild transformation this month was, from dabbling on RH (twats) to opening several accounts and throwing thousands of dollars into the chaos.

Anyway, I just wanted to stick some daggers into the system and each one cost me over $200. But it was fucking worth it. About as expensive as a rough weekend in Vegas but with 10 times the entertainment and 100 times the memories. Win or lose, we were a part of history. I'd rather be a retarded ape on the field than prodigy in the stands. 10 years from now, Johnny Shmuckatelli will barely remember what went down this week, but I'll be fisting my wife's boyfriend and he'll scream in agony as he remembers...

One strategy that could be designed to take advantage of the potential profit opportunities created by a stock becoming hard-to-borrow (thereby putting the Put/Call Parity into imbalance) is to initiate a Reversal. The activity is most often done by broker-dealers who claim to rely on the exception to the locate requirement for options market makers found in Rule 203(b)(2)(iii).24
The options market-makers claim that they can enter into the short stock position without first locating the shares to borrow because it is part of “bona fide” market making activity. Although an options market maker engaged in bona fide market making activity may claim an exception to the locate requirement, to comply with Reg SHO, the options market maker must still deliver shares in settlement of the short sale, or if a fail to deliver position results at the clearing firm, the fail to deliver must be closed-out in accordance with Rule 204 of Reg SHO. It may be a violation of Regulation SHO, however, where the options market maker does not deliver shares, and instead engages in a second, subsequent transaction in order to give the appearance of satisfying the clearing firm’s obligation to purchase or borrow the security to close out the resulting settlement fail pursuant to Rule 204 close-out requirements (“reset transaction”). In addition, where a clearing firm subject to the close-out requirement purchases or borrows securities on the applicable close-out date and on that same date engages in sale transactions that can be used to re-establish or otherwise extend the clearing firm’s fail position, and for which the clearing firm is unable to demonstrate a legitimate economic purpose, the clearing firm will not be deemed to have satisfied the close-out requirement. Moreover, if the clearing firm or broker-dealer that was allocated the fail to deliver position enters into an arrangement with another person to purchase securities as required by Rule 204, and the clearing firm, or broker-dealer that was allocated a fail to deliver position, knows or has reason to know that the other person will not deliver securities in settlement of the purchase, then the transaction is a sham close-out, in violation of Rule 204(f).
The Initial Transaction Example:
• Stock XYZ trading $51.00
• May 50 Puts on XYZ trading $3.00
• May 50 Calls on XYZ trading $3.00
Trader A: Sells 10,000 shares XYZ @ $51.00 Buys 100 May 50 Calls @ $3.00
Sells 100 May 50 Puts @ $3.00
In this example, the “synthetic” position is trading for $50, which is simply Call Price - Put Price + Strike Price. The actual shares are trading for $51, so that Trader A has effectively sold shares for $1 more than it paid for them, in a simultaneous transaction. Each time the trade is made, Trader A is earning a $100 profit26, assuming that (a) Trader A is not being charged a fee to borrow shares to deliver on the short sale and (b) the clearing firm does not effect a buy-in against the trader to close-out a fail to deliver position.27 In this case, the trade was made 100 times, so that the profit would be $10,000. The sole reason for the disparity between the actual shares and the “synthetic” position is the fact that the shares of XYZ are hard to borrow.
The Second Transaction to “Reset the Clock”
Assuming that XYZ is a hard to borrow security, and that Trader A, or its broker-dealer, is unable (or unwilling28) to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares, the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A’s clearing firm. Rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery, or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market, Trader A might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the broker-dealer’s close-out requirement, but in reality allows Trader A to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale. Most often, this is done through the use of a buy-write trade, but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of
Short term FLEX options.29 These trades are commonly referred to as “reset transactions,” in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the broker-dealer must purchase or borrow the stock to close-out a fail. The transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares, when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations. The buy-writes may be (but are not always) prearranged trades between market- makers or parties claiming to be market makers. The price in these transactions is determined so that the short seller pays a small price to the other market-maker for the trade, resulting in no economic benefit to the short seller for the reset transaction other than to give the appearance of meeting his delivery obligations. Such transactions were alleged by the Commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement cases.30 Such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firm’s responsibility to close out a failure to deliver.31
Trader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer’s close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position.
These circumstances vary. For example, Trader A may be engaging in buy-writes with a known counterparty, such as another market maker (Trader B) that Trader A pays to take the other side of its reset transactions. In this circumstance, Trader A and Trader B agree on a price at which the buy-write will be transacted. The trade is consummated as a spread, with the stock and option portions executed at the same time. Trader A sells calls to Trader B, and Trader A buys shares from Trader B. The size of the trade is dictated by how many shares Trader A is required to deliver to appear to have closed out the settlement fail arising from his short position and avoid a buy-in or large borrowing fees. Trader A knows or has reason to know that the counterparty to the buy-write will not deliver securities in settlement of the transaction. Rather, on the same day of the buy-write, Trader B will, in almost every case, exercise the deep in-the- money options it bought from Trader A in order to eliminate the short position created by selling shares to Trader A in the buy-write transaction, negating Trader A’s purchase of those shares. The two counterparties trade deep in-the-money calls with little to no open interest, so that Trader A knows that when Trader B exercises its calls, Trader A will be the one assigned32 on the exercised calls. As a result of the assignment on the exercised calls, Trader A has another delivery obligation. Trader A, or its broker-dealer, remains unable (or unwilling) to borrow shares to make delivery, and the reset transaction may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A’s clearing firm. The result may be a persistent fail to deliver position in the security at issue.
Trader A may also be engaging in buy-writes with unknown counterparties, but structured in a way that Trader A knows or has reason to know that the calls will be consistently exercised and assigned to Trader A. In particular, Trader A’s buy-writes involve deep in-the-money calls on hard to borrow securities with little to no open interest. The end result is very likely the same: Trader A, or its broker-dealer, remains unable (or unwilling) to borrow shares to make delivery on the assignment of the exercised calls, and the repeated reset transactions result in a persistent fail to deliver position at Trader A’s clearing firm in the security at issue.
To the broker-dealer or clearing firm, it may appear that Trader A’s purchase, in the buy-write, has allowed the broker-dealer to satisfy its close-out requirement. Trader A continues to execute a buy-write reset transaction whenever necessary, and by the time of expiration of its original Reversal, it may have given up some of the profits in the form of premiums paid for the buy- writes, but it has maintained its short position without paying the higher cost to borrow or purchase shares to make delivery on the short sale. In each buy-write transaction, Trader A is aware that the deep in-the-money options are almost certain to be exercised (barring a sudden huge price drop), and it fully expects to be assigned on its short options, thus eliminating its long shares.

Dearest mods <3  I'm trying to get this post approved (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc70ca/meme_stocks_the_infinite_game_and_how_the_game/) but I am being blocked.  Here it is for anyone that stumbles onto this thing I put an insane amount of time into.

Meme Stocks, The Infinite Game, and How the Game has Changed the Players

Pre-pandemic WSB member with Asperger's here – I have designed stupid board games and video games for years, and while I have spent a ton of time watching what's going on and thinking about everything, I was suddenly reminded about the game design concept of ""Finite and Infinite Games."" It's worth viewing the current situation under this lens and I wanted to shine some light on how this game design concept factors into meme stocks, and what everyone (including myself) has missed until today.

All of this is my opinion. It is not a recommendation or financial advice or a call to action even if it looks like it. My positions are long GME and NOK in small amounts because I am poor, but I got in super early on both so I have no plans to sell.

Finite and Infinite Games

For those that have never heard of this, it comes from a book with the same name (yes I can read) and even smoothbrains can understand the main idea:

Finite games have a clear end and the purpose of a player is to win. Football is a finite game. Monopoly is a finite game. Getting your stock to a certain target price and selling is a finite game.

Infinite games do not have a clear end, and the purpose of a player is to stay in the game longer than the opponent. The game can even outlast the players. Running a business is an infinite game. Exploration is an infinite game. The Cold War was an infinite game.

When finite-minded players enter a finite game, or when infinite-minded players enter an infinite game, the game functions properly. But things get wild when a player sits down at the wrong game.

The Vietnam War

I'm stealing this section from the beginning of Simon Sinek's incredible talk because I am lazy and it fits the point I'm trying to make.

The US got into the Vietnam War to win a war. If the enemy ended up flying a white flag, victory is achieved and uhhh, freedom. They were playing to win the game (finite-mindset) and they won a lot of battles.
But the Vietnamese were fighting for their lives and their way of life. Their goal was to get the other player to drop out or simply outlast the opposition until they left (which the US did). And the Vietnamese were willing to fight to the last man to do it.

The United States won a ton of battles but the Vietnamese won the war.

What type of game is the stock market?

We can answer this a lot of ways but my simplest take is this: the stock market is a weird beast because it's an infinite game (outlast your opponents) but most people play with a finite mindset: A player tries to get their stock to hit a certain target price, and they cash out (win) and leave or play again (pick a new stock).

During the past few weeks, a tremendous amount of players entered the meme stock game and used orders and limits to win so they could leave. Their opponents did the same.

Even when the rules are lopsided, the game functions as both sides (🐃 vs. 🌈🐻) try to cheerlead and do whatever they can to fight for their side, short or long.

📉 Enter Robinhood 📉

It's no secret that last Thursday, the rules of the game drastically changed for players in meme stocks, as millions of players were suddenly knocked out, impacting the score for every other player. Demand is directly linked to price.

By artificially collapsing demand during one of the biggest bull runs in history, a referee (Robinhood) essentially robbed all the players on one side of the game to benefit the opposing players. This is why there was a sudden and immediate outpouring of powerful people from all angles condemning the action. The referee broke the game (meme stocks fall because the demand is suppressed) and no timeout was called.

How finite-minded players adjusted

Players of the finite game that got robbed now came to a crossroads. They could

1.	⁠Hold and keep playing (💎🙌), hoping their meme stock would hit their target price
2.	⁠Cut their losses and sell (🧻🤚) to keep a smaller profit or prevent deeper losses

The players that were benefited by the shakedown also had a choice. And that choice looked different because of their advantage:

1.	⁠Stay with the meme stocks, hoping to get their stock to the target price or better
2.	⁠Cash out, and maybe move to other stocks immediately because holy God this meme stock well is poisoned and the volatility is insane

At the end of the day, all these players are looking to cash out at a number, so even though they are on different sides, and meme stocks are crazy right now, the game is still playable.

If you haven't fallen asleep yet, here is the part where things go off the rails and no one is talking about it because no one has put the right words to it yet. A HUGE NUMBER of these finite-minded players have been turned into infinite-minded players**.**

Through the cacophony of all you paste-eating morons yelling at each other, I have noticed some major changes in the way people are talking about their meme stocks since Thursday:

•	⁠""Food Stamps or Lambos. GME to the moon.""
•	⁠""Do I die with NOK or get Cremated with NOK?""
•	⁠""I'm holding AMC until they make a movie about us""

All of these are hilarious. But there is something deeper going on psychologically with these people, and it is clear to me that they have changed from a finite-mindset to an infinite mindset. Let me break it down.

When these players got robbed, it instilled in them a righteous desire for justice.

I'm sure a bunch of them are familiar with The Big Short, or were connected to the 2008 housing market crisis, and they're all aware of how these things happen at the expense of the common man and no one gets punished.

In their minds, the only path forward now is to get revenge by putting the game back on its original path, through their sheer force of will. They will die playing this game, and they cannot be reasoned or argued with. Maybe they still have a target price in mind, but I need to be even more clear:

These infinite-minded players are working to get the other players to drop out and they are not leaving

Remember that Vietnam War analogy I used earlier? Right now, finite-minded players who only care about the target price of a meme stock are simply looking to win. But the converted, infinite-minded players are playing the long game, and while they may have limited resources (the Vietnamese were completely outgunned and outnumbered), you will only be able to these people from their position when they win.

📈 What does this mean 📈

I'd be lying if I said I knew, but I can wildly speculate for the rest of this post, which I will do and you will listen.

The market is always trying to achieve equilibrium, but what we are seeing is a motion to achieve rules equilibrium. These players were cheated, so they have created their own set of rules to play by: buy and hold. While these players may be small in number, they are going to quietly drain the supply without anyone noticing.

The floor for these meme stocks is going to continue to rise, and these players will continue to get people on board and things are going to snowball. At some point they will attract the attention of people with real money who believe in their pursuit of justice. And unlike the squeeze we started to see last week, the supply and demand curve is going to be so out of whack, you are going to see squeezes that will blow your 🦍 minds.

🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 Even if these people lose they win 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀

Imagine for a moment that GME collapses to $20 a share. Maybe the next quarter financials are abysmal. Do you think for a moment that these people aren't going to be dumping every single dollar they have into it? This will be like Christmas to them, because GME is not an investment in their minds, it's a ticket for their cause. It's the path to revenge.

What about if anything bad happens to DFV after he's pulled into a congressional hearing? These people know that it's not smart to storm the capital. They're attacking where it matters and they're using their money.

Some of these people saw what their position was at $480. It was staring them in the face and it was going up. They watched it plummet in real time. Can you imagine the level of conviction these people have? Do you think the hedge funds or even the other players have this level of steadfastness? These people have diamond hearts.

I'll say it again: If someone with a lot of money is smart enough to notice all this, the nuclear bomb of a broken supply and demand curve is going to explode, making these infinite-minded players rich, and demolishing those with weaker backbones. We might lose a chunk of the market each time one of these nukes goes off.

Personally I don't think we're ever going back to $20 for GME. I'm shocked that it's even close to $90 right now. But the truth of the matter is this:

The infinite-minded players have divorced meme stock price from the financials and it will be that way until we reach a point where the game resets to where it was on Thursday

This may take days, weeks, months, or years to get there for some of the meme stocks, but it doesn't matter because these people have invented their own rules and there are more players in that position than you or I think. The media will eventually stop talking about these meme stocks, assuming people have walked away, but these people have found their cause and they will be committed to it until their wrong is righted. And they are literally willing to die trying. 💎🙌💀

Please, please, PLEASE be aware of this. The mindset of a large number of players has shifted almost overnight and they have chosen their battlefield. None of their opponents are fighting the game at their level. And throughout history, when infinite-minded players have played an infinite game against finite-minded players, the infinite-minded players have won. They have won every, single, time.

You have my well wishes of luck in the future, but you don't have my sympathies if things don't pan out for you. The stock market has destroyed far more lives than your own. It's also has been a lifesaver on the exact flip side.

Then they did a stock split in August 2020 and got added to the SP500 in December. Now their stock is trading at stratospheric levels.

GME has already taken over WSB, much like Tesla had done. Now they have Cohen, and if fundamentals improve only slightly, then stocks could skyrocket, forcing a stock split and SP500 inclusion. Thus GME could be trading just as high as Tesla at trillion dollar valuations.

Disclosure- I sold my Tesla stocks and own GME. Past GME performance is not indicative of future GME performance. I also have a diversified portfolio and encourage safe financial decisions."

1612413157.0,39,Why WSB is getting investigated by the SEC and how it relates to WSB “culture” vs. the “movement”,"
I’ve lurked here for a year or two. I never really posted until the GME event. I’m holding my bag with pride, knowing I put my money where my mouth is on a cause I view as important. (600 gme @ $181.52)

A lot of people here are angry to hear the SEC is investigating this sub. After the massive level of bullshit we’ve seen these past few weeks in the media and the markets, I was pissed, too. 

But then I started looking through various GME “diamond hands movement” posts tonight and almost every one had someone saying “there is no movement, there was never a movement, we are here just to make money.” If I were y’all I would think twice about making that claim for a couple reasons. 

First, if that’s true, your mod team permitted a falsified movement to be promoted here just for the sake of manipulating the market so a select few of this subs users could be enriched by said movement. And any of you paper hands who were promoting it just to pump your own earnings were too. It would have been very easy for the mods to start mass bans and for y’all to downvote *anything* related to an economic movement, but that never happened.. I wonder why 🤔

Second, your sub absolutely chose to become home to a movement whether you signed off on it or not. DFV did not intend to start a movement, that’s 100% true. He’s just a dude with the right combo of smarts, luck, and capital. He has nothing to do with this. 

It’s this community i am taking about. At this point, the number of people who joined the sub during this event out numbers native citizens.. by *a lot.* The mod team saw what was happening and chose not to ban talk of said movement. Many of you who are now gleefully ripping on GME holders (of bags, myself included) took part in the festivities as well. WSB bent over the barrel for these new idealistic investors faster than a $12 whore. 

So here’s ultimately where you stand: you sold your sub out to a shit ton of normies just so a few of you could make some money and as a result you *may have actually engaged in active market manipulation.*

You either accept that there’s a lot of economically pissed off people here who are trying to figure out how to make money while sticking it to the man, or you enjoy getting deep donged by the SEC. maybe both! 

Either way, WSB as you knew it is 100% dead. You killed it with a meme stock. Congratulations. It’s a new sub now, and you old idiots don’t own it anymore cuz there are way more of the newbies than there are of you. 

Enjoy all the normies hanging around, I guess. 

Tl;dr: WSB isn’t the WSB you used to know and love. That WSB is dead forever. Get used to it. And maybe quit punching down on people who came here to invest in an ideal. It’s bad karma, and the SEC is taking note."

Made some nice tendies in last 2 weeks off GME and NAKD plays. Now in APHA for an options play...

**Positions: APHA $19c 2/19** (which I may even roll further out - TBD).

I'm bullish, at the very least, on the run-up to the merger expected in Q2 ([source](https://aphriainc.com/tilray-inc-arrangement-faqs/)). However, I realize this is ultimately subject to shareholder vote. Given that the reverse merger is architected to prevent dilution of existing shares, I don't expect it not to pass. Even so, I can't seem to find anything that indicates when exactly that vote is expected except this statement from APHA website's merger FAQ page...

*Do I get to vote on the transaction?*

*Yes, you will have a chance to vote on the transaction at a meeting of shareholders. The transaction must be approved by at least two-thirds of the votes cast by Aphria shareholders. Full details of the transaction will be included in a management information circular of Aphria to be mailed to Aphria Shareholders in the coming weeks.*

Obviously, this passing would ensure myself and other APHA bulls don't get rugpulled AND perhaps might even lift the stock since so many here probably haven't priced it (e.g. recent influx of newbies). Has anyone received this yet? If so, what date/time does the vote take place?

1612413073.0,24,Let’s count our shares. PLEASE READ! 🌖🚀,"In advance, sorry for the wall of text. TLDR at the bottom: please take the time to read.

Shareholders are being attacked by HFs using the price of the stock. They are instilling fear for losing money on what many thought was a strong plan. The HFs know that the shareholder will be emotional about their holdings. They all have been there and they know what it feels like. We don’t know what it’s like to be where they are sitting. We don’t truly know if our actions are instilling fear in them. They are likely confident that they can break us. They are an organized company. We are a lightly organized group of random people. Our strategy is to hold. Their strategy is to break that hold. So they attack us. You come on to WSB to see that other people are holding still. You check to see if DFV and Mark Cuban are still telling us to hold.

We need to show them our numbers. Yeah, anyone can read the number of current members of WSB and if you sort by “New” you can see the stream of loss porn for those who are ✋💎🤚 
When we see a stream of people holding, it’s comforting. Let’s back that with data. We need a count of the number of shares that we collectively hold. If Melvin is trying to get our shares, we need to know how many we’re holding. 

A poll or census needs to be distributed in order to take a count of what we’re working with. This works for a couple of reasons: we know what strength there is in our numbers and the public will see who we are as a group. I saw someone mention that if we all had 3 shares each, there would (at the time) be 21 million shares distributed among us. I hold 20 shares. DFV is still holding 50,500 as of his update earlier today. Do we have 10 million or do we have 60 million? Let’s find out. Vote this up so people can see this and we can have a discussion on the validity of this idea. Maybe people already have and I haven’t seen it.

I deeply hate the fucking financial system. I see it destroying the world. GameStop was a dream for my childhood. It’s honestly one of the only parts of my childhood I care to still hold onto. I love this stock and I hate the system that crushes individuals and families alike. I hate being a slave.

TLDR: Let’s take a poll to figure out how many stocks we hold as a group."

1612412960.0,47,THE SMOKING GUN. SYNTHETIC LONGS BEING USED BY HEDGIES TO MANIPULATE THEIR EXPOSURE. PLEASE READ,"If shorts have covered then why are they driving the price lower and lower? Every time their is any light they spend millions to drive the price right back down. They are still actively working to save their ass and these past 3 days they have been winning and changing the sentiment on WSB. 

In my opinion SI% is still very high. Why is trading  still limited? Because the Market Makers, and the brokers could lose their ass if they opened the flood gates.  Shares are scarce because we are fuckin holding and the shorts cannot cover all of their shorts. Their goal is keep the price low and disguise true SI% until we get off the gas. 



Very interesting perspective on the ladder attack going on:

https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/

“There are at least two plausible explanations for GME short interest declining — giving the appearance of hedge funds covering more than half their shorts — even as the GME share price fell sharply alongside.

...

The first explanation is that GME squeezers lost their discipline and broke ranks.

...

In this second scenario, though, the hedge funds that are short — with tens of billions of dollars on the line — could have decided to play a high-stakes trick.

The trick would be: “Make it look like we’ve covered our shorts when we really haven’t (because we can’t), so that short interest falls and the Reddit army gets demoralized, thus breaking the squeeze.”

The way the hedge funds could have done this — made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn’t — involves trickery in the options market.

The tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a “risk alert” memo on the topic in August 2013.

The SEC memo is titled “Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.””

Maybe plenty of us are true believers in a long play at GME. Some just boarded the hype train. Now that we're all 💎🙌 together in this, I wanted to open this thread up so peeps to share why they like the stock. Maybe y'all have ideas of how to solve one or more issues holding GME back? Heck, maybe via proxy power we have the ability to add pressure and get some shit done. More likely I've strained my only remaining brain cell, but eh, it's probably fine.

As a former frontline grunt employee with GME, I know the customer base is broad and the core audience is heavily invested. There is an enduring emotional investment in the retailer and a strong brand recognition as a household name. Love and hate are both passionate possitions and that strong reaction to the brand name speaks to a unique positioning and strong potential ability to connect with the growing subcultures surrounding and supporting the brand to date. I'm still not sure about Sherman, but I'm completely thrilled to have fresh, relevant, and diverse faces on the board, especially Cohen and Reggie, to forge a better place in this space for GME over time. 

GME has good cash flow, access to hard to get IP licenses, and solid relationships with vendor partners, but has struggled to find the brand identity and experience that could put it in the rabid-fanboy/fangirl/nongenderconformingfanperson level of companies in the broader ecosystem like AMD, Sony, Nintendo, <insert your favorite game developer/publisher>. Imagine if rather than, ""we make technology affordable and simple,"" GME evolved its experience to become a holy church for gamers and gaming culture like the NYC Nintendo store or many Apple stores. It wouldn't take much, IMHO. The frontline staff's passion for the brand is already uniquely positioned for this to the point where I've heard many minimum wage earning employees tell me that it was their childhood dream job. Embrace that. Expand it.

That's where I see the company's opportunity to move from a ""finite game"" ideology to an ""infinite game"" mentality (credit: Simon Sinek). That is not so different from what Reggie helped to build and grow at Nintendo of America. Add that to Cohen being able to turn up the volume online via omnichannel and every storefront already being a mini distribution center. Add some level of profit sharing being announced with digital sales for this new console cycle. Squeeze or not, I like the stock.

TLDR; I like the stock. Share why you like the stock.

Edit: I'm a novice learning some shit and having fun, there is plenty of good DD but it is not here. This is an opinion an not financial advice."

The stock will pop so high all will make a killing but no stock crash and many will not get burnt. For example, this pandemic knocked down a lot of stocks that will go back up very soon. Why not force them back up now before the Wallstreet jumps onboard and when they do, the stock will pop higher. That is how you play it smart with this much power so no one gets burnt.

CCL was previously above $60. It is at $20. Many Wallstreet investors jumped ship in 2020 waiting for a reversal and will be back. Beat them to the punch. The cruise ship has enough funds to avoid bankruptcy, has high demand and will start sailing at the end of May. Which means the stock will start popping. We don't wait, we jump aboard, push the price up to a reasonable level BUT below the prior highs. Then wallstreet jumps in which they will again, they will push it to its fundamental highs. While we walk away with profits. When the market corrects, hold.

Retail traders in this instance is made out to be a failure, (despite confidence in AMC) it's a con or a snake, even media I sow willing sold to their benefit as their corporate mob, to rape society.
While the SEC instead act to negate the improper conduct of instrument holders as a third party interest AKA Hedge fund and in part brokers.
The SEC announced two days ago they were looking to make sure retail trades were not manipulated, while allowing SEC LICENSED HEDGE FUNDS TO RAPE RETAIL TRADES driving the stock of AMC down 10% mid day but failed to initiate the SSR rule.
Brokers being given the availability of Hedges for gain, and the SEC in allowing Hedges to short beyond market demand/capability until the resources were tuned on them.
For what purpose such greed that risks the economic stability of the nation and global concerns? A promise to another form of investor?.....Equality my ass. What stance does the SEC now make to protect by what standard of investor?
We know the numbers they don't lie at all.
That's the undoing in the end game.
The make in the end to the win game is facilitated by the SEC.
I have an absolute despise of the SEC laziness, and perhaps incompetence.
They are bought out useless by any definition.
They are truly a meme or willfully hindering proper oversight, I vote the later.
Should not the SEC now be held accountable (and be legally bind to recoup losses on behalf of all retail traders? without a specific fine other than being a proper legal award?) in regard to fines of hedge funds improper behaviors? Or does the SEC admit they allow irresponsible Hedge Funds to manipulate a supposed free market?
IN THE END, WITHOUT RETAIL TRADERS HEDGE FUNDS LOSE BEEITCHES/funding UNIONIZE RETAIL TRADING.
Correction a good percentage of hedge fund gains (3x) should be seized and distributed between stock holders.
At peak in this point of Right. The the SEC is teaching and yes instructing retail investors to go with the flow, and when they do what happens to the hedge funds? they lose their bets, since no one is left in the retail trade to be opposed. Stupid arrogant, greedy fks.

There's a time and proper season for everything, take a fucking slight loss deserved or will end tomorrow.

Like many of you newbies I bought in to the hype around GME around the peak. I believe that if Robinhood hadn't restricted trading the squeeze would have already happened, but that's besides the point right now. Investing is a complicated game, and that's really what it is on this side of the money. A game. You have no control of over what happens to your money after you put it in the slot, the company will do as it will and you just hope you get some green instead of red.

Here's the squeeze, investing has a cost of entry. No matter when you got in the game you would have had to pay a price, and your subject to the same swings as everybody else on the market and every other smooth brained retard or autist. Every investor has lost money at some point, be it on paper or realized. Not every investment works out, and if you're new it can be discouraging to have your first attempt blow up in your face. But you paid the cost of entry, you opened an account and started trading, and the next trade might go differently.

Learn about options, learn about margin, learn how to read all of those fancy graphs that your broker offers you. Read up on what a company is doing and how its performing year over year and against its competitors. Come over here and pitch us on it with a well thought out DD. Include🦍 🙌💎🍗  for the retards.

Use this opportunity to transform into an AUTIST, like some beautiful retarded butterfly that made a chrysalis out of loss porn and 🙌💎 memes. Grow your knowledge as an investor, and TAKE ANOTHER CHANCE. Invest in what YOU believe is going to succeed, or if you're still too retarded for that read a DD someone else made. If you're confident, YOLO IT! Odds are someone else will do it too, then you can either eat tendies or stand in line at the food bank TOGETHER. And THATS what WSB is about, being RETARDED TOGETHER. And making (or losing) a SHIT TON of money.

&#x200B;

And remember; even a retarded gorilla picks the right stock twice a day.

Who are they and why did they make Robinhood, Revolut and others to stop buying AMC and GME? I don't know much about economy stuff, but I know they increased the margin a lot (or something like this?). Don't get me wrong, I don't defend Robinhood and the others, I'm just asking questions. I was doing some reading on Wikipedia and was amazed to see how much money are in the game when it comes to them. Hell, I never thought that so much money can be in the game. But why now? Why did they stopped the trading when it was about normal people, the working class who are trying to make a difference and point out about what is wrong with the market and basically with this world?

1. If you’re going to invest in stocks the first thing you need to do is join a Facebook group. 
The people there have already done the homework and know exactly what they’re talking about. 

2. Second, look for post that just have the ticker symbol ex: $abc
That way you know exactly what to buy without doing any hard reading. 
Picking a winner is easy. Just look for the following emojis. 🚀🌕📈👐💎🚂

3. Always, always buy high and sell low. 
Dont bother reading books or looking up quality youtube videos. You didn’t need those economics or finance classes in school, you’re buying a lambo anyway.

4. Then complain about your losses to the same Facebook group because you didn’t know what a stop limit was or when was the right time to pull out. 

5. Become cynical and bitter about any stock, that anyone mentions, but continue to not understand market mechanics.

6. Assume everything is a pump and dump trap. Even though there is evidence to the contrary. #AMC #GME #shortladderattack

Both have a period where there's a huge jump in the price, then fall to relatively similar levels by stock average over trading the few following days after. Even the volume seems similar if I'm reading this correctly?

The company is doing amazing work in the fight against cancer, specifically in regards to leukemia. For example, their anti-leukemic therapy (GPS) showed a median overall survival of **21 months** vs the **5.4 months** survival that is currently available (Phase 2 study). That is incredible, and I can't think of a better company to support than a company that is fighting cancer (which affects everyone)! They also signed an Exclusive License Agreement with China to commercialize GPS and the next generation, GPS+, across all of China (potentially $202M in licensing, not including future royalties). If you want to learn more, you can take a look at [this DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/trakstocks/comments/l9w5ty/the_next_bngo_sellas_lifesciences_dd_inside/) on Reddit.

Also, there is definitely something going on here beneath the surface, because today (Feb 3) **the stock was up $1.22** with no news being released. For some reason, news outlets have been saying that the uptick is due to Reddit, but I didn't find many threads that got a lot of attention. Potentially there is some big news underwraps, so I'd be interested to hear what you guys think about it. I definitely would love to know if there's any info I'm missing out on here, as it seems like a clear cut winner to me.

I know that SLS isn't a funny meme stock like GME, but I honestly think it's a worthy cause for us to support as a community. Especially because a bunch of investors/hedgefunds are shorting a cancer-fighting company to make some money, which is a pretty scummy thing to do imo.

1612411854.0,5,Noobie with Some Questions,"1. Why is trading information, like active shorts and active options only available to the big firms like Citadel? 

2. How do they claim a stock is publicly traded with full transparency if only big firms know trading information not available to the public? It seems like wallstreet treats it like a privately owned company at that point. If a firm is paying for information only available to them, then that's not a publicly traded stock.

3. Why is an IPO only available to the big firms until they get done profitting off it until it dives down to lows? Shouldn't it be called an Initial Private Offering?

I feel that the general public is being gamed hard and there should be more public/transparent information that the SEC should require to be known. When the most vital information to a trade is withheld from the general public, that stock should no longer be considered publicly traded. The stock market is a private club for the rich. Why are they pretended it's publicly traded?"

Silver would be way more fun to squeeze than GME, just notice how every single mainstream media outlet went up in arms firing 20 articles per hour as soon as you started talking about silver. Why do you think is that?

1612411526.0,0,Hear me out: Should we really be killing Robinhood?,"I know we’re all extremely pissed off in Robinhood’s buy limits/buy blocking, which pretty damn directly killed GME momentum. But, I’ve been thinking a lot about this, and I feel kinda guilty for jumping on the “let’s kill Robinhood” train. They’re not my primary brokerage, but, the more I hear and read, the more I’m convinced that Robinhood basically had no choice but to set the limits they set.

There’s no excuse for their lack of transparency when this happened, and I’ll stand by that. But really though, would retail trading and WSB have the power they have if it weren’t for Robinhood? Wall Street is now fully, painfully aware of the power we (retail traders) have. We move markets, even when they try hard to keep us from moving them. And I think it’s pretty undeniable that Robinhood helped create this, and without Robinhood we may not be able to sustain it.

We’ve now made them the target of the regulators. Not the hedge funds, Robinhood.  Legislation and regulation that affects Robinhood will affect every other retail brokerage, every novice investor, everybody who can’t afford to put $25k+ into a brokerage account, everyone who can’t afford commissions.

It’s pretty clear to me that Robinhood was more of the victim of corruption and manipulation than the perpetrator of it. Again, there’s no excuse for the lack of transparency, and I hope they’ve learned their lesson, and we should hold them accountable. But, this sub has an immense amount of power, and I don’t think we should be aiming it at Robinhood... effectively our former friend. When a friend stabs you in the back, it hurts, and I think we all feel that way. But I don’t think the blame lies with them, and I think Robinhood helps us a lot more than it hurts us. Food for thought, fine to disagree with me, and I’m open to being wrong and changing my mind. I’m just worried about where this goes and I think we need to step back and look at the big picture. If Robinhood dies, it’s the hedge funds and institutions who will be laughing, a lot harder than anyone here will.

And since no one actually looks into the data, they’d just do it without knowing if the story was true.  And they’ve been selling all of their shares to newbies coming in to buy at the all time high. 

B) The short thing was true, but shorters used what /r/wallstreetbets is doing to make even more. They could sell their borrowed shares after the price was driven up. Then buy them back now that the price is tanking. They get to make money on one last pump and dump before they have to give the shares back. And if it drops low enough, they can make money off the original short too.

Surly a mass movement of the people with no political alliance / ties will make more of a mark against the system than some opertunist politician's who will just hijack the voice of the people and purposely just use it for personal gain and extra publicity then fail the people as they always do!


The 2008 financial crisis hurt people the world over I was living in London at that time and people were hurt you saw it everywhere the world over( my family are South African ).

The people have a voice, it's being heard the world over, now you guys need the worriors now.

Bloomberg reports that the SEC are going after Reddit users for market manipulation.( Not the hedge funds or the media)

I haven't seen one post where people are offering to help those that might be in trouble but innocent ?

It's literally the people Vs them coming and they gonna use every penny every dirty trick and they gonna make sure they send a message!

Should there be a go fund me to pay for the best lawyers in the world ?

Will there be an army of volunteer lawyers ?

Will there ever be a real power for the people ?


This looks like the best place to start, there's no politics here's only people who seem to exposing a broken system that seems to have control over both polical party's.

When change starts in the USA it filters out the rest of the world very quickly, you guys are the masters of media and the message it carries and that is a cold hard fact.


Are the people gonna stand up ?



Edit : I think I'm wrong I think there should be a 3rd  political party involved I think this should be pushed to @jimmy_dore and his push for the people's party.

Taking this to the next level with his viewership and voice and possible connections with glen greenwald and co.

If the ""people's party"" could adleast make a dent in the current situation there would be such an influx of unified people it would become the true opposition the current system!

I may take some heat for this, but if you don't like it, fuck you. 🖕

I'm seeing a lot of bullshit and fake news being posted here daily about the recent APHA/Tilray pump that has been happening all over reddit. If you look at any of the big investing or stock forums you will see posts about how APHA/TLRY are the best way to play U.S. Cannabis legalization. 

*Insert rocket emojis right?* **NOPE**

**The reason you dipshits are getting played is because Apha and Tilray don't have a single license to grow or sell cannabis in the United States.**  If you want to play the U.S. Cannabis boom, you should be looking at investing in American companies, CGC or the sleep-easy pick MSOS ETF which holds all the top U.S. pot stocks.

**Again, Apha/Tilray are a Canadian producer that owns a small U.S. craft beer company without a single license to grow or sell cannabis in the United States.**

Claiming they will be ""the world’s biggest cannabis company."" will be short lived at best as they most likely won't even be in the top 5 when U.S. decriminalization occurs. Curaleaf , Green Thumb, Cresco, Trulieve are all U.S. multi state operators and they are all top players that will continue dominating the U.S. 🔥🔥🔥

I'm also seeing A LOT of comparison between APHA and CGC with people claiming that Aphria will move up to match Canopy's market cap. CGC is a beast and they are backed by Costellation motherfucking Brands (STZ), a fortune 500 company who invested $5 billion in them. They have used that money to open their own wholly owned retail stores, a beverage plant, they have Biosteel sports nutrition which is the official drink of the Raptors, Sixers and Mavericks, Martha Stewart CBD, they have several celebrity and athlete endorsements (Patrick Mahomes, Gleyber Torres, Ezekiel Elliott, Conor Mcdavid), This Works cosmetics, Storz & Bickel, and they sell CBD pet products as well. And of course, a clear path of entry into the U.S. via the acquisition of Acreage a U.S. multi state operator in 15 States with 29 open dispensaries and 7 production facilities. they also have a stake in Terrascend another U.S. MSO.

**Aphria has none of what I mention above. Don't be a fucking donkey.**

There is no way for them to surpass any of the top players in the space. Once the APHA/TLRY merger is completed, their combined company cash to debt position will be hot garbage and will need to be addressed. On top of that, the only way for them to enter and compete and get licenses in the states is to acquire a U.S. multi state operator and the only way that will ever happen is? you guessed it fucktards, doing a raise $$ and diluting shareholders. (wouldn't be surprised to see it happen soon with the recent run up)

With the dems now having control of the house, the senate and the presidency and Chuck Schumer making his intentions clear that cannabis reform is a top priority this year this rocket ship is about to blow everyone tits off. 🚀🚀🚀 The hype is back in marijuana land. 

You would be better off going with literally any of the U.S. multi state operators over them or MSOS. If after all this you still think APHA/Tilray is a better play for U.S. legalization, you're most likely adopted.

With that being said, here's a few more rocket emoji just in case. 🚀🚀

I'm no expert, do your due diligence and fact check what you read before making any financial decisions and don't be fooled by thinking a Canadian license producer with no money will dominate the U.S.

1612411108.0,21,A look inside the office of Melvin Capital,"My name is Juancho. I'm currently a paid intern at Melvin Capital and have been doing this for a few months. I got this job after I was arrested for forging fake checks. Gabriel Foreskin saw what had happened and admired my ambition for money and the lengths I would go to create fake money for the benefit of myself. He said I was just what he needed and taught me everything I needed to know about synthetic shares and shorting stocks. He told me there was no limit for short selling and to just keep injecting non-existent shares into the market. He said to me slowly, like I was retarded,  ""it literally can't go tits up."" So I did as I was told. Rick from office block C said thats what he was doing too. He explained that if we just jack it up to the tits with shorts that there is no way Gamestop can come back. 

That was only 2 months ago.

During the end of 2020 we saw a small rise in GME stock which hurt our short position but we blew it off due to the new console cycle. We assumed after the consoles were sold, their company would finally bite the dust. We were wrong. After the stock hit $200 I saw Mike from block F call his wife and kids to tell them the horrific news. They were going to have to sell off their 4th jetski so now there will only be enough jetskis for 3 of them. Rumor has it his wife threatened to leave and his kids won't call him ""dad"" now. Danny, the janitor, was so upset about bankruptcy rumors that he shit in the elevator and quit on the spot. Pretty sure Danny pissed in Jimmy's cup too but that fuckwad deserved it. It was one of the worst days I've seen here at Melvin Capital. We hoped we'd seen the last until I got a tweet notification that sent chills down my spine. I went into the office of Gabriel Foreskin to tell him the news.

""Sir?""

""Yeah come on in, what is it?""

""Elon tweeted,"" I said. ""He said 'Gamestonk' with a link to the retards burning down our firm""

I’ve been 💎👐 on a few lots of pot stocks HEMP, MJNA, NDEV, and CNABQ to name a few and they’ve been bearish for the better part of the last two years, but I won’t sell. They’re trading at extraordinarily low values (>$.07 per share), which is why I am able to purchase larger share amounts, hoping that upon federal decriminalization these securities values will spike. While the stonks have been bearish for most of the last two years, these securities seem to be experiencing a significant upward motion since Monday.

1612410912.0,4,What happens to a stock price if there are more buyers at lower prices than sellers at higher prices?,"Hypothetically, following your question, if we have 10 sellers who placed a combined sell order to sell 1K shares at $11 and we have 20 Buyers who placed a combined order to buy 2K shares at $10 and there are no other traders, then there will be no trade - price remain unchanged - bid did not meet ask.

If you ant to manipulate price and have enough $$$ for that and you want to buy at lower possible price, then theoretically speaking, you may do following - this example is simplified to lower volume for better understanding , in reality volumes are much higher:

let say a stock is traded at $10 per share and there are only 10 sellers
.You place another order to sell 20 share at $9 and that order is executed and price of your stock drops-crashes to $9 which is 10% loss in one day. You lose $10 (1$ on each share)
As your stock lost 10% it created panic and now other traders are ready to sell this stock at $9.01 because they are afraid of deeper crash and now, there are 1000 shares are available at $9.01
You lost $10 to push price down, yet, now you can buy 1000 shares $0.99 cheaper.
As you bought 1000 shares you created a volume surge. Before we had average volume = 10 shares per day and on the day of your purchase we had volume = 1000 shares per day
you continue to put small buy orders at a little bit higher than he market price and you create some up-move. The other trades see that price bounced up and they start buying this stocks and they will move price up without you.
you caught 1000 losers and you just sit and watch as other loser move your stock up
This is very simplified example and it is very difficult to implement, unless, you have a lot of money and you can cover either supply or demand of those traders who you want to play against. It is still possible that some institutional traders may manipulate low volume stocks and that is why Richard Wyckoff (in his ""Stock Market Techniques"" book) does not recommend trading low volume stocks - they could be manipulated easily.

It is difficult to manipulate high volume stocks, still, when you see a strong volume surge after a strong decline, as in point #5 above, it means that some big institutional investors are buying and if they continue to buy in big volumes, they will reverse this stock from a decline. 

That's what Hedges are doing right now.

**1.Past Posts and A Few Nitty-Gritty Additions**

Many of you have seen the DD done by u/johnnydaggers   [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/) (you STILL okay bro?), as well as the information on this website: [http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) (If you haven’t read this yet fucking do it right now, and read the whole thing.)

Now...I’m a skeptical as fuck autist. I don’t just believe anything at a glance, and a lot of the information contained in the white paper “Counterfeiting Stock 2.0” doesn’t contain many links to the cited supporting documents or specific references...and that troubles the autist half of my brain. So I decided to at least spot check and zoom in on a detail that caught my eye. 

&#x200B;

**ZOOM-- ENHANCE!**

(See: Counterfeiting a Stock 2.0 - Part 6-  Why does this continue to happen?)

* Both houses of the Utah legislature passed a bill that required daily disclosure of fails–to–deliver, including identifying specific companies and the specific broker dealer positions in that company. The bill also outlawed naked shorting of companies domiciled in Utah. The industry threatened litigation based upon federal preemption and backed the state down. The bill was not signed into law.
* In February 2007 the SEC determined that the hedge fund industry did not require any additional regulation — they are virtually unregulated. This may be the height of arrogance.

I searched for the specific bill the author mentioned in Utah. (For those of you who don’t know, you can look up all laws proposed and passed at the local, state, and federal level. They document all of this shit.) Well, I found it and read enough of it to satisfy my semi autistic brain:

[https://le.utah.gov/\~2006S3/bills/sbillenr/SB3004.htm](https://le.utah.gov/~2006S3/bills/sbillenr/SB3004.htm) 

For those of you who are less autistic than I am, here are the most important parts:

**S****ummary**

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**SUBSTANTIAL Penalties imposed on ALL parties responsible for a failure to deliver.**

Here’s what the authors of the white paper got wrong though, the bill passed almost unanimously and WAS signed into law ([https://le.utah.gov/\~2006s3/status/sbillsta/SB3004.htm](https://le.utah.gov/~2006s3/status/sbillsta/SB3004.htm)). However, it was repealed later. Again, with an overwhelming vote: [https://www.investmentnews.com/utah-votes-to-repeal-fail-to-deliver-law-7720](https://www.investmentnews.com/utah-votes-to-repeal-fail-to-deliver-law-7720) 

It seems they were bullied into doing this by SEC and SIFMA (Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association). This is the first time I’ve heard of this player in the game. They are an advocacy group supporting the rights of the securities industry (lol). They are staffed mostly by big players in the banking and securities industry. They are a “non-profit” with a CEO who is compensated almost $3 million/year. This number is from the CEO in 2012, I can’t for the life of me find any info on salaries after that date so I can only assume that it’s higher now. (info from: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities\_Industry\_and\_Financial\_Markets\_Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_Industry_and_Financial_Markets_Association).)

Look at all of the cool things they are doing: [https://www.sifma.org/resources/archive/news/](https://www.sifma.org/resources/archive/news/) 

&#x200B;

**2.Back to the Self-Incriminating SEC doc**

If you haven’t yet, look at this report below, read the first 3-5 pages at least. It’s an executive summary, published BY SEC, about counterfeiting shares and the roll it played in the financial crisis of 2006-2008. 

[https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf) 

THEY KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING. FUCKING READ THAT REPORT YOU FUCKING RETARDED AUTISTS. IT’S PUBLISHED BY THE SEC AND SUGGESTS THAT WE MIGHT BE BUYING COUNTERFEIT SHARES THAT ARE BEING CONJURED INTO EXISTENCE RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR FACES. 

OUR STRATEGY TO BUY AND HOLD IS PROBABLY THE BEST THING WE CAN DO, BUT WE MIGHT BE PUTTING SOME MONEY BACK IN THOSE FUCKERS POCKETS FOR THEM TO RELOAD. WE (retail investors) MIGHT OWN MORE SHARES THAN ARE EVEN SUPPOSED TO EXIST, NOT COUNTING WHAT OTHER INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER SHAREHOLDERS ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE.   


FUCKING REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

&#x200B;

**3.What does this mean??**

If this is true, and as pervasive in the system as all of this shit suggests. They could be stealing billions, if not fucking TRILLIONS of dollars every year, at everyone else’s expense. When I say everyone, I mean fucking EVERYONE, the entire world economy revolves around the US market. The fraud here creates excess capital in the system that isn’t backed by any real securities, i.e. inflation. Your money is worth less when these fucks start counterfeiting shares.

&#x200B;

Explanation in retarded ape terms:

Let’s say you and your friends have 10 **🍌**. You each paid one **🍗** (tendie) for each **🍌**. Each **🍌** is still worth 1 **🍗** and you can trade it in at any time. (We’ll assume that the value stays constant, doesn’t really matter if the price goes up and down for this example as it obviously would in the stock market). But uh oh! Here comes a **🐍**. He made 5 fake plastic **🍌** and he decides to sell them to you retarded apes. You each pay him about one tendie for each fake **🍌**. Now there is a larger supply of **🍌** than there should be! Let’s say in total that it cost you all 14 **🍗** for all 15 **🍌** (due to the reduction in price caused by the surplus **🍌** in the system). Mr. **🐍** slithers off with 4 **🍗**!!! You and your friends now have 10 real **🍌**, 5 fake **🍌**, and you paid 14 whole **🍗** for them! Silly retarded apes. Oh, and since you and your dumb fuck friends can’t count at all, and/or lose count every 3 days, you have no fucking idea how many total **🍌** there are!

&#x200B;

**4.What Else Can We Do Besides Staring At Tickers and Scrolling Through Memes?**

So what do we do? Well...I think the place to go now is to raise as much hell as we possibly can while we continue to **💎🖐️🖐️💎**. We shouldn't just sit around waiting for the Robinhood hearing. Fucking Feb. 18th?? My thought is that Robinhood might just end up being the fall guy; mostly a distraction from all of the other shit going on. It may have even been legitimately out of RH’s control to some extent. Vlad claimed that their clearing house suddenly demanded $3 billion more from them in collateral, leaving them scrambling. Meanwhile, the HFs are still up to their dirty tricks. 

ALL of the responsible parties need to be investigated and held accountable. This could even include the NYSE itself, DTCC (for either clearing fraudulent transactions or failing to resolve the FTDs), Citadel, Melvin Capital, and SEC. Hopefully this would be done by a committee completely independent from SEC, maybe it would even be the DOJ. If the “counterfeit stock” theory is true, and actually, even if it is just good ol’ fashioned market manipulation, then all of them, at every level are complicit in this. This isn’t an isolated case as others have pointed out.They are all trying to cover their asses here to “protect the integrity of the entire marketplace and the interests of investors.” Translation: fuck with it however they want, in whatever way benefits them and maintain the status quo.

**TL;DR**

\- First of all, fuck you, that monkey spent a few hours researching and compiling this shit. 

\- Specific details in “Counterfeiting Stock 2.0” verified. Lends a little more credibility to it imo.

\- We \*might\* be fueling some of the HFs ability to keep going in this fight by purchasing their counterfeit shares. But our best option is probably still to **💎🖐️🖐️💎** and buy the dips.

\- Open the floodgates! File Complaints, email your local and national reps, and reeeeee

1612410505.0,17,"Value is about perception, not a price tag.","Over time markets go up and they go down. Housing prices go up and they go down. Too often I see people stressing over what something is worth in dollars, rather than seeing the inherent value in the item itself.

When the housing market collapsed in 2008, people lost their minds because their homes were worth “less”, but guess what, no one took the house away unless you sold it (for a loss) or stopped making payments and the bank foreclosed. If you just needed a place to live, and kept making payments, you kept the house, and over time, the market recovered and all that money that was “lost” also came back.

Stuff has value beyond the paper value. Pay what you think it’s worth and be confident in your decisions. You will always live in regret if you worry about prices only going up. Because there are always times where they will go down. Do you check how much your car is worth every day? Do you care if you buy a refrigerator and then it goes on sale a week later? Do you sell all your watches and jewelry the moment gold prices start going down?

Make decisions with your money knowing that prices will ALWAYS fluctuate.

If you buy a 🍌 for $10, and then 🍌 goes on sale for $1, you still have a 🍌. No one took your 🍌. And if you like 🍌, buy more 🍌.

Had to get that off my chest.

The animosity between bulls and bears on $GME lately is absolutely ridiculous. **BEARS**: It's not ""how this sub always was"" to completely shit on people for holding a position. Let them do whatever the fuck they want and anticipate the loss porn for breakfast the next day if you're so sure they're screwed. As long as you're ONLY dealing with money you have to lose, and not liquidating your ROTH to play a gamble, then you have every right to be here and invest like anybody else.

**BULLS**: However, the number of people saying it'll still go to the moon and downvoting every opposite opinion they see is a huge issue. They know that this event will likely stay on people's minds *for years to come* \- especially with the different studios trying to capitalize on the situation and sentiments real time - but that does not mean much for the longevity of your play. Already this week we see that we're at a point where we can exhaust the capital from the people willing to invest and lose all of our money in the process.

I'm personally **bullish GME, 69 $GME@98**, and it sucked to see the whole squeeze kinda fizzle out and into what it is now. Even though I'm anal about it, I'm **\*not using emotions to dictate my investment\***. I truly believe in the value of Gamestop under Cohen and the new VPs they signed on today, and a tiny little part of me is still invested in the idea of a potential squeeze in the next few years that I'm still not selling.

Truly, we \*won't know for sure\* whether there's the potential for another squeeze, short or gamma, [until those numbers come out from the FINRA this next Tuesday the 9th](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest). I've heard some say that it got delayed to the 15th but I haven't been able to find the source on this myself. Since the opinions on this are so binary, there will be \***\*no way of knowing whether this is all conspiracy or not\*\*** until we have some guaranteed bonafide proof that the shorts **\*\*ARE OR ARE NOT\*\*** in.

Until this point,  it is baseless to make a case about whether the squeeze is still on or not. Even the slightest confirmation towards the squeeze case will likely induce another gamma squeeze, since attention will be redirected toward a short-term high growth %; conversely, even the slightest vision that the shorts are out and we're sitting here floating in space will likely tank the stock with sales across the world - and definitely kill a conspiracy theory or two. The stock would likely only go back up when the

For this key reason, I think this situation is a 50/50 gamble. If you'd like to keep the gamble going, or feel like the losses aren't worth realizing, then fuck it. You do you. I hope you research opportunity costs related to bagholding and are willing to pay them as you move forward as an investor. If you're **\*not\*** willing to take the gamble, then **\*don't\***, and stop dicking in the ass everybody who's willing to make a truly retarded play; after all, the spirit of this place isn't so black or white...

Anyways.... Switchback Energy is a SPAC that a lot of you I’m sure have seen before. They are merging with Chargepoint.  This got postponed once and is supposed to happen this month sometime now. Chargepoint is the biggest ev charging company in existence. Chargepoint is bigger and worth more than blink even though Blink is priced higher and showing more market cap than SBE which won’t be right for long. 

As we all know, EV’s are booming and are the future. Chargepoint is only going to grow more and more. They’re the biggest ev charging company by far. 

I’m willing to put my money on the price of SBE going up quite a bit following the merger. It’s a pretty damn safe bet. And this is also a very great Looooooong position in my opinion as well. I’m going to snag some shares in the am as well as some more 40$ calls expiring march 19. I already hold 5 contracts but plan to buy 10-20 more and a grip of shares. 

TLDR: SBE merging with chargepoint this month hopefully. Chargepoint is big company worth a lot and growing. Great long position. Should pop off soon. 

THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. FUCK OFF SEC. I LIKE THIS STOCK AND I BELIEVE IN THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE COMPANY.

A system of ""market capitalism"" and ""bootstraps"" that all of a sudden doesn't apply to the rich. It's all laid bare now, thanks to you and your diamond hands.

Even if they win this battle (which doesn't have to be, we can still win, and if you look at Melvin and Citron, in many ways we already have), we will win the war. We will make a system that is for all of us, not the. 01%. We will bring back the rule of law (The idea that the law applies equally to all of us. Funny thing, huh?).

Okay, clearly there has been a lot of weird info out there and it is hard to know what is what when it comes to just about anything related to GME (or anything related to last week). Quality information is hard to come by outside of you retards.

That being said, short interest Tuesday was up to 20% of traded shares from 18.5% Monday and an average of \~17% last week ([https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)).    Today, that number spiked to 25%. I'm retarded, so I won't feign that  I   really know what this means. But it seems to this retard like 1/4     shares purchased today were sold short, and yet the stock held its price   (of course it did, we love this stock). I only have the brain capacity for two theories, and I'll happily take suggestions from the comments.

1. Shorts were all opened after the intraday peak around $108 to smack it back down to \~90. Given the all our posts are public information and we are clearly down to the diamond fuckin handers here, this seems a risky play for anyone that isn't already invested in the short side of this stock.   Confirmation bias: MOASS part 2 is still on. *EDIT: Turns out it is relatively cheap for massive firms to short right now (between 10 and 20% borrow fee), which furthers my idea that this was what happened.*
2. Most of the shorts opened this time were smaller short positions opened by boomer retailers crazy enough to gamble on this stock returning to its  ""fundamentals"" (wtf are those?). These smaller short positions didn't flood the market fast enough to counter the ask slappers that believe in the MOASS's part 2.

The MOASS would have happened last Thursday. It's why we are pissed. It's criminal brokers interfered with the will of the people. It's insane how coordinated the misinformation that ensued was. Now it's personal. It ain't over ever. I continue to like this stock. Daddy Cohen's got a vision.

Disclaimer: I buy high and sell low, so what do I know. Nothing here is financial advice. That should be obvious by the fact I titled this ""short interest"" instead of ""short volume""...

1612410020.0,228,$GME has a MAJOR asset that's being overlooked...The Geist of the Squeeze,"(FROM THE HEART)

I started with 1 share at $350 so I could say I was here.

Now I got 15, aps $161.

I had no idea about the whole GME thing until last week.

I  bought the first share as a lotto ticket. The last two were the easiest shares I’ve ever bought.

I hope the squeeze happens, but if not, I still consider this an investment I’m happy to make. And that’s how I consider it now, an Investment.

I bought a lotto ticket on GameStop stock, realized I own shares in this phenomenon called $GME, and bought more.

GameStop is the videogame store that the slowest, flakiest weed dealer in the Chicagoland area worked at back when I was in Highschool.

$GME? I can’t define $GME because right now...it is simply *beyond.*

$GME is at the center of a movement that got support from AOC and Ted Cruz...AT THE SAME TIME IN 2021!!!!

$GME has been given the most aggressive, effective, and expansive advertising campaign in the history of anything...for free. Communist dictators struggle getting the same amount of coverage...in their own regimes!

$GME has…

\-A fucking $NFLX movie already optioned!

\-Mass news coverage, worldwide, real or not.

\-The FUCKING INTERNET

\-The rocket emoji (WTF else could it be associated with now?)

\-Customers buying and donating $GME products to charity.

\-People buying Billboards, all over the world. A free street team for everywhere!

\-Peoples. $GME could have more than brand loyalty, it has the possibility to “have peoples.” Like Applefolk. I really hope they don’t fuck this up. I hope to continue being a fan.

\*\*\*\*And if there are any $GME Execs who think something like “Well I wouldn’t call that adverti…” Then my entire thesis is wrong. But after reading Ryan Cohen's letter to the Board, I’d be surprised that someone who thinks that way would still hold any position of influence at $GME.

$GME Has MONEY with VISION. Have you read Cohen’s letter? I think I read it once two days ago after seeing DFV mention it in one of his posts. I read it again earlier today, but this time after having read Cuban’s AMA. That was critical. Between Cohen’s letter and Cuban’s wisdom, something happened. I ACTUALLY- LIKE DEEP IN MY SOUL- BEGAN TO LIKE THE STOCK!!!

So I stopped trying to daytrade FD’s to average down shares, and took a more intentional look at $GME’s story and plan moving forward.

$GME should be so much more than a video game store, in the same way that McDonald’s is so much more than a fastfood restaurant. It’s like when Harry Sonneborn went to Ray Crock and was like “Bro, you ain’t a restaurant owner, you’re a FUCKING REALESTATE MAGNATE!.” Ray didn’t know what he had... the template for a business that wouldn’t just disrupt the casual dining industry...it would DEFINE it.**WHO THE FUCK IS THE MACDONALDS OF GAMING?!**

$GME is in a position to wipe out EVERYONE in one of the fastest growing industries in the world. We don’t even know how the video gaming is going to mature as an industry yet, just that it’s gonna be bigger than it already is.

Cohen knows this, DFV knows this, any of you who have been truly following GME before the circus began prolly came to the same conclusion.

And Cuban knows this, but I think he saw something bigger.

Did anyone wonder why one of the most prolific and popular billionaires in the whole world might expose himself to possible legal or PR disaster, just so he can do an AMA on one of the most politically incorrect discussion forums on the net, at a time when it’s being watched like hawk by fin regulators? Not only that, afterwards, he goes on a PR crusade in support of WSB!!!

Why? **Because this is the place to be.**

And this pushes all those assets and ideas listed above to whole new level.

There may be something WAAAAAAYYY bigger than a squeeze, a turn around, or even the advent of a gaming empire. Mass Media hysteria, AOC and Cruz agreeing, dogs and cats living together! There’s something bigger that’s possible, and I’m not sure Cuban even knows what it is, just that it’s BIG and since he’s Mark Fucking Cuban...he made sure he was in it, but even more so, took a side and defended a conviction...For what? a bunch of tards chasing a squeeze? A chance to look cool in front of millennials? FUCK NO!...AND DOUBLE FUCK NO TO THE SECOND ONE!

We were all looking at charts, wondering what lines do, and scouring the sub looking for reassurance and more retarded DD, that I think we missed the value of $GME’s newest asset:

**#GME fanatics and the Social and Cultural phenomenon they started.**

What is the possible financial gain from the spirit (Geist) of the Squeeze ? I have no idea, but $GME is in a wholly unique and unprecedented position to find out. And this sparks joy and wonder in my soul.

I’m grateful to all the work DFV has done, but I'm also grateful he is no longer posting updates. The pressure on that man to hold...HES STILL IN, IM STILL IN? That’s the only comment for like the first 1k comments!!! It was to the point where actual lives could have been at stake if he didn’t post an update, let alone a stock price. Have you watched his vids? Have you seen how fucking chill and cool he is? It's insane to think about the weight he carried.

Nonetheless, I’m in because I like the stock. That’s it. But I like to think DFV has similar ideas to those explained above, and will continue to hold for the same reason. I also like to think there’s a few VC’s out there with similar thoughts. Maybe a few billionaires that are looking for something that can be truly Good and new.

Lastly, All of the radical and possibly delusional assumptions I made to come to this conclusion might be absolutely wrong.

TLDR: I actually like the stock. "

I personally feel bad for DFV. Being the “leader” of this subreddits new 💎✋🚀🦍 cult following must be stressful and also horrifying. Also the government is now looking into him being the ring leader behind all of this even though he has months of detailed data proving that it was just luck...

Let’s say my assumption is true and he does cash out. I hope he gets past all of this and moves on to a better life. He has money to do whatever he wants and everyone wishes to travel the world and experience that lifestyle. My prayers go to him, his family, and future life.

But still l, from today I started to feel also the pressure of the lost.


Also checking here the various posts I’m  noticing a downgrade of the good vibes given by diamond hands, the to the moon and all that nice newsporn and mathporn on our side.

Is there some good news that makes us think that we could still get to the moon?
I’ll hold surely cause there’s literally no reason to sell now, but there is still hope to see the stock over 150-200$?
Is everything gone?
Is something big still gonna happen?

Being in a fiscal pickle myself, and a know-nothing on stocks besides, I decided to take out $25 dollars and start an investment account to play around with. Within a few hours I had acquiered my first AMC stock and 3 SNDL as they looked promising (at least for a few hours). I admittedly caved to fear, then simped back to getting one more SNDL. My accounts value dropped to $13. 

This morning I put my big boy pants back on and took another AMC at 8 or so bucks and some other tech company who's ticker is banned (why?). I now lay my head down with $3 cash in the account and my account being valued at $17.

Ape TLDR at the bottom you smooth brains

While researching batteries, I came across a corporation by the name of Energous (WATT). They are the leading the charge in a phenomenon called over-the-air wireless charging. Aka charging small electronics without needing to be contact with a surface or corded power supply, instead the device is charged by an RF transmitter.

Their primary product is called WattUp, the RF transmitters that allow them to charge devices over a frequency with a variety of applications - drones, medical devices, laptops, etc.

They have recently partnered with NewSound in December and received FCC approval for a WattUp enabled hearing aid, to eliminate the need to replace the small delicate batteries.

FCC approval for a WattUp enabled posture tracker.

They also have the first FCC permitted non-beam forming transmitter with a charging area of 1 meter, and a total of 230 patents as of Jan 2021. 

Finally, as of Jan 5th, they have completed a $40m at-the-market equity offering. 

This technology has incredible capabilities and could soon be found in any electronic device imaginable, and Energous is at the forefront. 

Currently shares are at 3.5~ from an all time high of 22.44. Currently both ITM and OTM options are pretty cheap with a nice average volume.

1612406147.0,6811,A rational (and bullish) take on the current state of GME gang,"I see a lot of FUD and bad DD going around r/wallstreetbets, and its time for more rational discussions about the state of GME and the potential for another bull run. It is possible, but people need to stop being next level retard. It is going to kill any opportunity to recover the stock unless we stop right now and get our heads straight on what's actually going on. So while I don't know shit and this isn't real financial advice, here's a more rational take on what we need to do to get GME moving again.

Full disclosure: I was in GME in early December at around $15, I was a pussy ass paper hands and folded a winning play of $35 call for Jan 15th when it looked more and more unlikely. I got back in immediately for Feb 19th calls and turned 4k into 70k. I took some profits on the way up (I felt bad for doing so but I knew it was the big brain move, and in the end I pocketed 40k on 4k investment so 0 complaints from me). I'm still holding $115 calls made when the stock was $70 for Feb 19th, and made more 250 calls recently for Feb 26th and Feb 12th at $130 and $100 yesterday. I'm holding all of these till bust, so I'm in it to the moon. I have some shares too but those are a long play, I don't look at them.

First, we need to accept or at least be open to the idea that the original short squeeze is done. The factors that led to it have changed, either the hedge funds reshorted at higher prices (around 200 most likely), or they can out last us because they know they have bail outs and the media has put the momentum against us. WE CANNOT COUNT ON THE ORIGINAL SHORT SQUEEZE TO REVIVE THIS STOCK. WHAT WE NEED IS AUTHENTIC BUYING AND NEW MOMENTUM.

On that note, stocks can move ridiculous prices on low volume. What we need is real, authentic retail buying at prices up to at least $200. But right now GME looks like a sinking ship and no one wants to touch it with a 100 foot pole. So how do we fix that? We still have momentum on our side from a large number of believers from around the GLOBE that want a part in this once in a lifetime story. This is powerful but has to be used right, and that's hard when the brokers are shutting us out. But hope is not lost, and restrictions should lift over time. We need patience and resilience.

We also need to stop telling people who aren't in this for the moment to hold till they die. Some people are losing REAL money over this and we're being complete assholes telling them to hold till they lose their life fortunes so we can make some tendies. Weak hands are going to sell and pressuring them to hold will make the FUD worse. If we want a come back we need the selling to stop, and that means we need to let the weak hands fold WHILE keeping the floor price above a certain level. Let's talk about volume. The recent 'low volume' isn't low compared to the past months, its just lower than the day when GME was THE MOST TRADED STOCK IN THE WHOLE FUCKING WORLD. Stop talking about volume. REAL selling has happened, which is probably the institutions and the paper hands folding. We need to let this energy run its course. Don't act like it's going to the moon and to buy at any price, save our bullets for the hard line in the sand.

Once the selling has stopped (and it will), we just need to regain momentum with organic buying.  People all over the world are waiting on the sidelines for GME to look like its picking up steam again and they will PILE THE FUCK ON just like last time. If we push the price high enough, we can trigger another short squeeze but it is NOT the same conditions as the first one. Stop with the bullshit about ladder attacks (which I've only heard of on this reddit) and us being cheated by the big man, that only scares people away because they think the game is unwinnable. It is STILL a giant fuck you to wall street just by making this stock rocket again, the game does not have to be rigged to make this a david vs goliath story. Whether it is or isn't, that only creates more FUD.

This sub needs to get its shit together. We need real authentic I LIKE THIS FUCKING STOCK for reasons OTHER than the short squeeze. Like GME just adding a fucking Amazon employee to the board and plans for it expanding online. There is REAL REASON to believe in GME, and that needs to turn into authentic buying, which will then create the momentum we need to get everyone else to pile on the stock again. But this shit about short squeezes and ladder attacks and $10,000 or bust needs to stop. It's just making this look like a sinking ship where everyone on it is stuck in the denial stage of grief. This stock has real potential to hit $300+ again, we just have to change our mind set and the game plan. And I'm too stupid to tell you how, but I know this isn't the way. So buy the fuck out of GME at current levels, but change the narrative to something that has actual basis in reality. And tell people to let the sellers sell so they stop keeping us down and we can get a real rally going. We have enough people on our side to move the needle and get the engine started again, its not over. But its gonna require patience and time and if you aren't in it for the long haul or are gonna pussy out on the way up then just sell now so we can start buying again. At this point, if you're not buying, either get off the ship or hold till death do us part.

Best of luck retards, I know we can do this"

""If you can keep your head when all about you,  
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;  
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,  
But make allowance for their doubting too:  
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,  
Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,  
Or being hated don't give way to hating,  
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;

If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;  
If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim,  
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster,  
And treat those two impostors just the same:.  
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken,  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,  
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,  
And stoop and build'em up with worn-out tools;

If you can make one heap of all your winnings,  
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,  
And lose, and start again at your beginnings,  
And never breathe a word about your loss:  
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew,  
To serve your turn long after they are gone,  
And so hold on when there is nothing in you,  
Except the Will which says to them: ""Hold on!""

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,  
Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,  
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,  
If all men count with you, but none too much:  
If you can fill the unforgiving minute,  
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,

* there's a risk associated with corsair bussiness which is they depend on third-party computer hardware, particularly graphic cards and CPUs, and video games. - if any of the above will see a decline  it may hard crsr business. - every year there's new GPUs, CPUs and video games, and corsair will be there to provide their equiment ! i dont see this bussiness declining soon, quite the ooposite - when people will get back to work they will have new money to spend on their PCs and game consoles, and dont forget about new stimulues.
* if eSports wont continue growing at the current rate and according to the excepted growth - there will be harm to sales.

&#x200B;

POSITIVE:

* gaming and creator becoming pupolar and keep rising at the moment.(not due to covid)
* part of corsair products are used for ""3 letters forbidden word"" mining.(GPUs and Power supplies)
* alot of rgb product that attracts young audience.
* variaty of products to all costumers (20$-1000$+)
* still and young company with a very promising future ahead !
* covid lockdowns made alot of people more aware to computers and gaming
* Alot of influencers marketing corsair.

i think that corsair is perfectly positioned to continue growing, at the current rate they are a value play at a steal price. streamers and youtubers marketing corsair products and as a result corsair can expect to keep their growth in sales. they can generate billions each year in the up coming years and i really think they are under valued right now.

combine that with the crazy time we live in, shortage all over the world for GPUs, CPUs and gaming consoles - the demand is crazy and corsair will benefit as well.

at 21, jan corsair just filed [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1743759/000119312521011458/d32212ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1743759/000119312521011458/d32212ds1.htm) because of their latest ""offering"".

why do we care about that ? thanks to some guys from r\\investing i found that that apparently their next earning are already out and nobody talking about that.

**For the year ended December 31, 2020, we expect:**

**• Net revenue to be between approximately $1,700 million and $1,701 million**

**• Net income to be between approximately $101 million and $103 million**

**• Adjusted EBITDA to be between approximately $211 and $213 million**

Yes, we already know they have beaten their own updated estimates…

In fact, the company initially estimated the following (*from Q3 release* [https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d))

For the full year 2020, we currently expect:

• Net revenue to be in the range of $1,616 million to $1,631 million.

• Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $178 million to $184 million.

• Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $187 million to $193 million.

Then, they updated the *guidance on November 30th 2020* ([https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-updates-full-year-2020-outlook](https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-updates-full-year-2020-outlook)):

For the full year 2020, we currently expect:

* Net revenue to be in the range of $1,651 million to $1,666 million.
* Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $186 million to $192 million.
* Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $194 million to $200 million.

**So they have beaten their own initial and revisited estimates. Great!! Really great!!**

**2)** But that’s not all we can easily infer from the Prospectus dated January 21, 2021 (Again… we just need to look).

As they mention on the Q3 report, “as of September 30, 2020, we had cash and restricted cash of $120.1 million, $48.0 million capacity under our revolving credit facility and total long-term debt of $370.1 million”.

In the more recent prospectus (page 10):

*In addition to the foregoing, as of December 31, 2020, we expect to have approximately $133 million in cash and restricted cash and we expect to have net debt of approximately $194 million following the repayment of $50.0 million in existing debt with cash on hand during the quarter ended December 31, 2020.*

**This means that they have reduced net debt from $250M ($370 - $120 of cash) to $194M, which implies $56M of free cash flow generated during the quarter.** As a reminder, they generated around 21M FCF in q3 2020 and 94M in the first 9 months of 2020. So **this implies around 150M FCF in 2020** (as a reference in the first 9 months of 2019, they had negative FCF of about 6M).

(check cash flow statement at page 14 on the Q3 report here [https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d))

And about their operation statement which looks pretty promising, this is how a growth stock looks, i see a bright future for them.

TLDR: Corsair is a straight up strong tech company which holds greater value than the market see right now, earnings on feb\\9 will be fire and beyond the earning i see a huge growth for this company. possibility of reachin 60$ after er is HIGH. play by your own risk.

i own 200 shares at the moment and about 6.5k in 50$ calls, might add another 15k next week.

1612405601.0,63,Reasons for buying and selling,"Hi all there been alot of discussion about buying certain stonks on the dip when restrictions are lifted and counter arguements on how to unretard and cut losses and sell at the low (Dave Portnoy anyone)

Again only use cash, practice risk management and importantly mind your ego. Money is a social construct and its the material embodiment of your time. 

Im personally holding because im investing my time to push the message of injustice on why big boys can fuk over retail with no consequences. Im not selling because im not folding my arguments and know its an investment to make the message worldwide. Yeah sure some will call me emotional and stupid for not taking money off the table or cutting losses. Guess what money is used exactly to make you feel better (nice food, stuff, sex, lottery) and this makes me feel better.

Again this is within my personal risk limits, my 8 shares rep 2 weeks salary, i can always do overtime to cover it."

Let’s leverage the collective wisdom of WSB and launch our very own r/Wallstreetbets ETF. We can easily raise the seed capital we need to launch and some of our ambassadors like Chamath would match the initial fundraise. If we could get Cathy Wood on our board to help manage it with Mark Cuban u/mcuban and others alike. Of course, u/deepfuckingvalue could help with analysis and technicals. With weekly asset reallocation based on WSB sentiment and the per below:


#Fund Allocation as follows:

WSB Sentiment: 30%

YOLOs: 10%

DD: 20%

u/Deepfuckingvalue: 40%

This could could turn in to the most successful and powerful ETF Wall Street has ever seen. Furthermore, we could issue 15% of the initial share offering to Autism awareness charities. This isn’t as crazy as it sounds and could be easily executed. 

#Also, HOLD 💎🙌🏻🚀

1612405286.0,71,Why $SQ will crush Earnings (Earnings Play 02/23),"**Preamble:** $SQ is currently trading at \~$228. They report their earnings on 02/23 and they're going to crush it! I personally think it's pretty cheap and it'll definitely have a run up. $SQ has two Lines of Businesses: Seller and CashApp. The Seller segment includes Square's managed payment services, software solutions, hardware, and financial services offered to sellers. The Seller segment generated $409.3 million in gross profit in Q3 2020, up 12.5% compared to last fiscal quarter. The other line of business is CashApp which is like Venmo meets Robinhood. They offer retail trading for stocks like $AMC, $NOK, B\*T\*C, etc. and they charge a variable cost for each transaction. Hence, high-priced asset purchase = higher fee. High volume purchases = more $. And then of course, you have your cash wallet.

Here are my bull points:

**Seller Segment:**

* Between November 5 (last ER) - February 23 (upcoming ER) there was Christmas, Boxing Day, Cyber Monday, New Year's and Thanksgiving. These are are all holidays that Small Businesses highly benefit off of
   * Retail sales will be up and same store sales will be up. Hence, more $ for $SQ.
   * Considering their Q3 revenues were up vs. last fiscal (when COVID didn't exist) and last quarter, Q4 revenue will be tremendous.
* More small businesses are open compared to last quarter. Vaccine started being distributed late 2020 -> more people shopping outside -> more small businesses profiting -> more $
* Most states (including businesses) are open ([https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html)).
* 2nd round of PPP: Credit lenders approved $5 billion loans in 1 week starting 2nd week of January 2021([https://www.fool.com/the-blueprint/over-60000-round-2-ppp-loans-already-approved/](https://www.fool.com/the-blueprint/over-60000-round-2-ppp-loans-already-approved/)). Small businesses aren't going anywhere and are here to stay.

**CashApp Segment:**

1. There was a very strong correlation between B\*T\*C and $SQ, but the derailment happened near the end of December. While B\*T\*C discovered new ATHs, $SQ remained stagnant. **Not priced in!**
2. According to survey results, 40% of retail traders who switched brokerages when the $GME, $AMC, etc. trading restrictions came about, they had migrated to CashApp. From this survey data gathered, Mizuho gives a PT of $300 ([https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3237659&headline=SQ](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3237659&headline=SQ)). **Not priced in!**
3. $PYPL earnings came out and claimed that C-currency had a big influence. Meanwhile, more C-currency is being traded via CashApp. **Not priced in!**
4. B\*T\*C trading volume nearly doubled vs. last quarter, and yet $SQ has only risen by 15%. **Not priced in!**

 **Other Bullish Points:**

* 1% of $SQ's asset is in B\*T\*C. B\*T\*C nearly 3x'd in the past 3 months. Meaning their B\*T\*C asset value 3x'd vs. last quarter. **Probably priced in.**
* CashApp 7th most downloaded in app store:

**Bearish Points:**

* The gremlin look alike that is Jack Dorsey is currently selling
* $ARKK is lowering the weighting of $SQ and $PYPL

**Assumptions:**

* EMT
* B\*T\*C doesn't crash before earnings

Take advantage of the low pricing right now to get in and using ER as hedge if you're planning to sell before expiry."

Right tards, I was here at 1.8milly so ik the culture but have sweet fuck all trading experience (read 3/4 of a boomer book and decided I’d rather get rich w yolo meme stonks) I got in on gme lateish for 50$ (been averaging up like an autist) I saw my t212 account reach £15,000 (English degenerate) at one point. I ignored family and friends telling me to sell bc I didn’t expect Melvin and his goons to fuck us with the various manipulating tactics (fake news, ladder attacks, bots, etc) now I’m sat on 3k and feeling like a dick.
I know people have lost lots more and still hold but I can’t lie I’m losing faith rn, the company is bullish long term but this isn’t r/investing, I wanted to sell half shares for 1000$, and hold the rest until Pluto, now I’m shitting it that the boat is sailed and I’m a bag holder.

 I can make some money if I sell now but I’d 100% be investing in $ROPE if it turns out I dimond handed too long to get nice gains; before paper handing before the MOAAS. Currently my ape brain tells me to hold until short interest is confirmed on 6th feb. But I’d hate to see it fall again between now and then.

1612404931.0,203,Merger Arbitrage between Aphria and Tilray. Free Tendies? What's the catch? Cannabis DD ($APHA and $TLRY) 🚀🚀🚀🚀,"Cannabis 2021 and Merger Arbitrage ($APHA and $TLRY Merger Arb)[https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4403082-aphria-approaches-52-week-high-in-cannabis-rally]

So if you've been seeing the headlines of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer addressing marijuana, you're probably considering getting some exposure to the marijuana industry. Not a bad idea. I think it is a great opportunity, and it's where most of my investments will be in 2021.

But let me tell you about an interesting opportunity within the cannabis sector. $APHA (Aphria) and $TLRY (Tilray) are set to merge by end of April or May, and together will form the largest cannabis company in the world. $APHA is purchasing $TLRY, but the new company will move forward under the $TLRY ticker. So what does this mean? 

Well, currently, the price of $APHA is $16.75 and the price of $TLRY is $25.75. The exchange rate for the merger of $APHA to $TLRY is .83. For every 1 banana from $APHA, you get .83 $TLRY bananas. 

Lets say I buy 1 share of $APHA today at $16.75 and the merger is tomorrow. My 1 share of $APHA will convert into .83 shares of $TLRY. At $TLRY current price of $25.75, your .83 of a share is now worth $21.37. Remember, you only paid $16.75, and now it is worth $21.37 just based on the details of the merger alone. 

This also works with options, which makes me *rock hard.* Your contract of 100 shares at a certain SP, will represent 83 shares instead after the merger **but keep the strike price.** You can *literally* buy deep ITM call options at a steep discount. A $25 $APHA call is OTM, but ITM for $TLRY. However, just so you're aware, in this case your max delta of your option is 83 instead of 1.0. meaning instead of getting a $100 to $1 move, you will get $83 to $1 move. 

I know what you're thinking. ""Well that's why it's discounted dumbass."" And you'd be wrong. Let's take a look at a couple call options and their prices..

**APHA calls only go up to $25 right now, even 2 years out. So I'll be using $25sp**

$TLRY $25c Jan 2023. That option is $1,218 to purchase, or $12.18/share. 

$APHA 25c Jan 2023. That option is $610 to purchase or $6.10/share. 

You're losing 17% in share control of your option, but buying at a 50% discount. 

Anyway, not financial advice. Just babbling. Could all be made up while I wait for my crayons to heat up. Plus prices can change, but beyond your average red day there's no reason to expect a hard nose dive from either company at the moment, and instead looks like it should be a good year for cannabis overall. Maybe the best year ever, especially as an American, but we will have to wait and see.

1612404922.0,114,Let’s face it.,"Listen up retards. I know nobody wants to hear this and I know it’s going against everything you all want to see right now but we need to face some serious fucking reality here.

Anyone who didn’t sell last week at the peak or around the peak, or on the way down, Welcome to the Bag Holders club. 

Now I know y’all are gonna downvote bomb me or be really upset about this shit, but it’s the fucking truth. 

We need to understand this and realise what our options are now. 

This place become a giant echo chamber of rockets and diamonds and “10k Is NoT A MeMe” bullshit. It was definitely a fucking meme and a lot of people got sucked into that absolute bullshit.

The big money bailed on us, they were happy to leave us bag holding if we were stupid enough to do it. (Spoiler alert: we were) there are no such thing as ladder attacks, everyone looks fucking stupid when they say this, the OG members of WSB are laughing at us all in a hidden thread. 

There is no squeeze coming. There is no more big money buying in. The squeeze narrative is gone, we can hold until we’re old and dead and out autistic grandchildren have our stocks, it doesn’t matter anymore. 

You need to realise if you’re still holding now, you’re now a long term investor. Congratu-fucking-lations. 

This is now a value play. Long term.

The reason I personally got in was because I believed this from the get go, before I knew about a fucking “short squeeze”.

I realised Ryan Cohen and his team are going to turn GameStop around and it’s going to be beautiful. Imagine getting on Netflix before it was Netflix, while they were still shipping DVDs? This is where we are with GameStop right now. 

The price will increase again, it will be valuable but it won’t happen for a long time. And it probably might not ever go to $400+ again. (Sorry bag holders at $400+) 

You’re a long term investor now if you’re still in. You’re options are this. 

1. sell for a loss now.
2. Hold and be patient, have faith in RC and the process.
3. Keep being a delusional idiot and getting laughed at. 

That’s it. That’s the options. 

My position is 150 shares of GME at an average of $70. I’m bag holding with you idiots.

1612404894.0,4257,"To anyone worrying, and I mean REALLY worrying about AMC or GME, heres some motivation.","Think to a place in the future in where months or a year from now, you'll look to these days where you didn't cash out. You made thousands, tens or millions because you had the nuts to hold when the cards were massively stacked against us. I won't lie, the cards have now stacked two decks. But we always have hope. Mark Cuban, DFV- The 20s Scarface (The world is his) , and the 8-10 million plus around the world who are with us retarded investors battling the system day and night. Think if you cashed in, you'd of given in to a system that keeps fucking you over day in, day out. You'll watch as everyone on here will make the paper bag, the biggest most of us will ever see. 

Its okay to be scared. I've been scared of a collapse for days, but that fear turns into strength. Fear, is what they want you to feel. But like apes, or the 300 Spartans, we are stronger together as one. They underestimate our power to virtually hold them hostage for what they've done. We hold the majority of shares, and were not going to stop holding and buying. They will run out of money soon, possibly again if were lucky. All we have to do IS KEEP HOLDING. They've rigged the markets for too long, the SEC sadly aren't on our side. Its time to show then where the bomb sights should be. Send them mass emails with evidence of corruption from the Hedgefunds. Keeo calling your attorney and show them the evidence. Do what you can to bring a fair game to the markets again. 

If the SEC sees this I am no way calling for market manipulation or cheating. I want a fair system for all, so we can all make the money and have all the bannaenaes in the world. SEC Investigators, look at the real targets. Melvin Capital , Robinhood , EToro , Citadel, and those in the White House. If we gain enough attention in the right direction the SEC will prosecute those who hide in the shadows. 

What keeps me going? A final thought. The picture of those in 2008 were waving and laughing at the protestors on Wall Street who were never brought to justice. Its about time we show the world that corruption comes from those above, not below. Godspeed apes, and God Bless. KEEP HOLDING, and if you can, KEEP Buying. 🚀✋💎"

1612403643.0,122,Putting forward an alternative view for $GME.,"Firstly, I hope this doesn’t get downvoted to oblivion. This is a genuine discussion I want to have to further help GME holder’s understand the situation and provide clarity.

This is in no shape or form financial advice, but my opinions on the stock and what has happened. I am holding 296 shares avg $37.

Have we stopped to consider that the squeeze has already happened? That initial jump from 100s to 480 last week may have been most of the shorts covering. Shorts needed to cover approx 70 million shares. If you look at the volume day to day from last week, 70 million shares could have easily been covered, as these days have very *high* volume. This is even truer when you factor in brokerage restrictions. If retail couldn’t buy, where was all of this crazy volume from? Most likely, it was the 70 million shares being covered.

If it is revealed that the short interest is still 50% or higher, this may very well be because HF’s took new short positions in the 400s 300s 200s. They are rolling in the green if this is the case. They probably bought options to also hedge against any potential issues. If this is the case, the short interest will appear the same on our end, but in order for a successful squeeze to take place organically, the price will potentially have to hit $500 organically for the new shorts to feel any pressure.

In terms of percentage as well, the jump from early double digits to 480 for GME was a bigger percentage increase than VW’s jump from 200s to 1000s. This solidifies further that the squeeze has happened, and the squeeze we saw was bigger than VW’s in terms of percentage.

I know a lot of people here got in 200+. So it would be great if we could get some solid discussion going on challenging what I’ve said. For the most part, it seems the squeeze has happened and any new short interest has a firm grasp."

My take- which is not financial or investment advice

1- Wallstreet is expecting a miss, which is good. They surprised eps big last time

2- They’ve been releasing nothing but fluff articles about forward rev and eps.

3- Just released teaser for raptor update(I expect an f series overhaul that’ll run into next gen. I know it’s only been a year but I expect and brand new f150 2022 as a preamble to the f150 ev line up. They’ve done 1-2 year gen ups in the past.)

4- guidance should be solid regardless of eps and rev. With new models coming out(bronco, emach, f150). We are in “recovery” at this point and f has already pushed multi-year high.

5- multi-billion dollar deal with... google.

6- said deal is for Android based os(expect googl to move as well)

7- dividend resumption?! This is speculation but with the positive outlook and possible beat on rev(or speculation on future rev like preorders) dividends could(not plausible imo) resume. Dividends come back so do the boomers.

1612403063.0,143,Canoo (GOEV),"Ok here is my first shot at a DD. I've been eyeing this company Canoo (GOEV) for a little while. I'm long 1200 shares @ a cost of $15.28

[https://www.canoo.com/](https://www.canoo.com/)

Canoo is a new EV start-up that plans to have a vehicle subscription service. From their investor presentation, it looks like they estimate $90,000 revenue on a car over 12 years. That means the cost per month for their subscription model is $625 per month, all in, no down payment, no insurance cost, they take care of maintenance, etc.

Link: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022608/ea125677ex99-2\_hennessy.htm?fbclid=IwAR2as\_F2t-ZrmXWjKGvDLROdeSmL5ByctPw3W0VuqEcOHYjZggG3d5FX4T4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022608/ea125677ex99-2_hennessy.htm?fbclid=IwAR2as_F2t-ZrmXWjKGvDLROdeSmL5ByctPw3W0VuqEcOHYjZggG3d5FX4T4)

Now, I know that seems a bit expensive but it seems that $625/mon is cheaper than the low end of the average of owning a gas-powered car at $750-916/mon. It has a barrier-of-entry because there is no down payment. I don't know how that will play out with most people. I personally like owning my own vehicle, but it could be popular with younger people because again, they wouldn't need to worry about any maintenance or insurance. Now, I do think their subscription model would be very popular among large companies that need a cheap, low-maintenance fleet of vehicles. I hope they're trying to land a contract with a company like UPS or FedEx.

What I like most about this company is their ""skateboard"" platform which is the bottom half of the car. From my understanding, they would just need to crash test one of each skateboard. Any vehicle, regardless of the configuration, would also have that crash rating, which is an amazing cost saving when they can sell a bunch of units to a larger car manufacture, like Hyundai, with whom they already have a partnership.

Link: [https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia)  


It is reported that Apple tried to buy Canoo in 2020 but Canoo turned them down. Apple has apparently partnered with Hyundai to enter the EV-space, I think because Apple really liked Canoo's customizable platform. Apple couldn't buy them so they joined them in a roundabout way.

[https://www.slashgear.com/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-report-electric-vehicle-skateboard-platform-autonomous-ev-roadmap-13654915/](https://www.slashgear.com/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-report-electric-vehicle-skateboard-platform-autonomous-ev-roadmap-13654915/)  


Having said all that, they won't have any vehicles out until 2022 so be wary of that, but this is a long-term hold for me.

Canoo (GOEV) currently trades at $16.40, hitting its all-time high at $22.30 in December. So, it hasn't had a crazy break-out yet but I'm confident there will be one closer to launch."

## What is delta and how is it used?

Delta is a useful metric to help traders measure the impact that movement in an underlying security will have on the value of their option positions. Delta is not a static number—it fluctuates due to a number of factors including the price of the underlying security, time to expiration, and volatility.

## The standard definition of delta is:

Change in the option price ÷ change in the stock price

## Why is delta important?

1. **Measuring expected change in option price.** Delta can be used to calculate how much an option’s premium is theoretically expected to change in response to a $1 move in the underlying security. For example, a call option with a delta of 0.50 would be expected to rise in value by about $0.50 if the underlying stock or ETF rises by $1.
2. **Calculating the percentage of price risk.** Delta also represents the percentage of price risk of stock ownership that is currently represented in the option. So, a call option with a delta of 0.70 has 70% of the price risk versus owning the stock outright. If an investor wanted a greater or lesser amount of price risk, they could choose an option with higher or lower deltas.
3. **Determining the probability that an option will expire in the money.** Finally, delta measures the approximate probability that at expiration the option will be in-the-money by at least $0.01 or more. Therefore, a call with a delta of 0.05 only has a 5% chance at that moment in time that the stock’s price will be higher than the option’s strike price at expiration.

2/3/21 **Delta: .3438**

**Every $10 up in stock price = +$3.438**

## What is gamma and how is it used?

Gamma is another widely used metric for options trading. It is most often used by traders with large positions, but grasping how it works can help any trader gain a better understanding of how options behave.

## The standard definition of gamma is:

Change in the delta ÷ change in the stock price

## Why is gamma important?

Gamma measures the rate at which an option’s delta changes as the underlying security moves. The gamma of an option reflects the change in the delta in response to a $1 move in the underlying security. For example, a call option with a gamma of 0.02 and a delta of 0.50 would be expected to change to a 0.52 delta if the underlying stock or ETF rises by $1.

&#x200B;

2/3/21 **Delta: 0.3438Gamma 0.055  (Delta+Gamma = .3493)**

**Every $10 up in the stock price = +$3.493**

&#x200B;

## What is theta and how is it used?

Theta measures the impact that the passage of time will have on an option’s price

## The standard definition of theta is:

Change in the option price ÷ one day change in time

Theta represents how much an option’s premium is expected to decay per day with all other market factors and variables remaining the same. For example, a call option valued at $3 with a theta of $0.05 is expected to be worth about $2.95 tomorrow.

Theta can change as the options get closer to expiration. For example, options with a significant time premium (e.g., those with strike prices closest to the current underlying security price) tend to see theta growing larger as expiration approaches. Another thing to keep in mind: Theta is exponential, not linear. That means the time decay of an option accelerates more each day as it moves closer to expiration.

## Why is theta important?

Time decay is an important concept in options trading. Theta is the metric that quantifies it, so that you can estimate how quickly you might make or lose money on an option strategy as time passes. However, remember that theta (like all the Greeks) is a theoretical estimate of what is expected to occur over time. On any given day, supply and demand in the market will determine whether an option’s price rises or falls.

&#x200B;

2/3/21 **Theta: -1.36 Decay  minus $1.36 per day**

**Current price: $10.83 - per day x minus $1.36 = $9.47 price tomorrow if nothing changes.**

## What is vega and how is it used?

Vega measures the impact that changes in implied volatility will have on the price of an option contract. Volatility can have a major impact on your options trade, so vega can be important for assessing the risk-reward profile of a given strategy.

## The standard definition of vega is:

Change in the option price ÷ percentage-point change in implied volatility

Specifically, vega represents the expected change in an option’s price for a one percentage point change in its implied volatility. For example, if implied volatility rises from 23% to 24%, a call option with a vega of 0.14 would be expected to rise in value by $0.14.

## Why is vega important?

Vega plays a critical role in determining the risk-reward potential of a potential option trade. If traders believe an option to be overvalued or undervalued, they may look at vega to decide which options and/or options strategies have the most profit potential.

2/3/21 **Vega: .0534**

**For Every 1% change in Implied Volatility (IV) = +$.0534 per pointi.e. 50% up would mean $.0534 x 50 points = +$2.67**

**Today was 373.1 IV - THAT'S CRAZY VOLATILITY.**

**The 52-week high for IV was 400.**

**There's a chance this breaks 400 tomorrow. ($.0534 x (400 - 373.1) = +$26.95 potential**

**Implied Volatility for Gamestop Corporation:**

**Current	        373.1**

**52-Wk Avg	97.3**

**52-Wk High	400.0**

**52-Wk Low	33.1**

&#x200B;

## What is rho and how is it used?

Rho measures an option contract’s sensitivity to interest rate changes, and is expressed as the expected change in an option’s value given a one percentage point change in interest rates.

## The standard definition of rho is:

Change in the option price ÷ percentage-point change in interest rates

How is rho used? For example, a call option with a rho of 0.02 would be expected to rise in value by $0.02 if interest rates rise from 2% to 3%. Rho can be positive or negative, but has the strongest impact on longer-term options and is often considered less important than the other Greeks by traders who focus on shorter-term options.

## Why is rho important?

In a low-interest rate environment, rho has a less measurable impact on option prices compared to delta, vega, gamma, and theta. Still, it is another metric that can be used to help understand how options are influenced by interest rates and may have some bearing on longer-term options positions.

&#x200B;

2/3/21 **Rho: .0052 = +$0.052 per 1% change in interest rate of borrowing sharesi.e. if borrowed shares interest rate goes from 19% to 29% = 10 points x .0052 = +$0.052 extra to the option price**

&#x200B;

# The Summary:

**For every $10 move up in the share price tomorrow; the options price will increase 35.13% (based on Case TWO)**

**Case ONE:**

\[IV is +1% and Interest Rate Increases by 1% and Common Share Price increases by $10\] = +$2.19**Gamma - Theta + Vega + Rho = total basic greeks**

**$3.493  -  $1.36 + ($.0534 for every 1% move in IV) + ($.0052 for every 1% loan interest increase) = +$2.19 (total basic greeks) / Current option premium price $10.83 = +20.22%**

&#x200B;

**Case TWO:**

\[IV is +30% and Interest Rate increases from 19% to 29% and Common Share Price increases by $10\]**Gamma - Theta + Vega + Rho**

**$3.493  -  $1.36 + ($.0534 x 30% move in IV= $1.62) + ($.0052 for every 1% loan interest increase = $.052) = $3.805 + Current option premium price**

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**SO PER EVERY $10 Move in SHARE PRICE, The Analyzed Option Premium Price Increased $3.805 or 35.13% from Last price on 2/3/21 of $10.83**

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL;DR: **SO PER EVERY $10 Move in SHARE PRICE,The Analyzed option (Can't Stop Won't Stop Corporation 2/21 160c) Increases $3.805 or 35.13% based upon Case TWO with 30% IV increase and 10% Interest Rate increase.**

&#x200B;

**If there is continuous BUYing and HODLing of shares and buying 2/5 call options  and the share price goes higher bc of diamond hands and buying by oldcomers and newcomers, the options price will continue to rise 35.13% every $10 increase in share price based upon Case 2 and can be even more as IV goes higher or Interest Rate borrowing % goes higher.**

&#x200B;

What would happen to the 2/5 Calls if the stock price rises every $10. Exponential Growth Possibly and the Final Squoze. The Share price needs to increase in a dramatic and volatile fashion. If 2/5 and 2/12 options are bought up and share price increases dramatically, the price will continue to go up infinitely until the shorts cover or are margin called.

Causing massive 'weird' moves in the stock.

And the retail investors who make up less than 3% of the ENTIRE market are being investigated?

Dope. Dope.

1. I’m not a bot

2. Fuck you SEC go after the trading app that prevents buying instead of waving the white flag and asking for an HALT to give time to raise cash... anyway

3. GME was in a unique spot... small float, over 100% shorts... squeeze was in a unique spot...

4. Now all the media and tweets and post are about oh this done... they gonna bag hold... movement is dead... THE SHORT dropped their position so it’s over...

Let me make this clear... you don’t need a 150% shorts to be able to squeeze em... it’s just way fucking easier and faster..:

A lot of new hedge shorted entering the game late when they saw the buying beeing blocked and made easy money... 

Even if the shorts are at 50% ... you can short squeeze em THE SAME WAY... by continually buying and holding you help make the price higher... even by buying 1 share... it has an impact because let me be clear... we are 8M... remove 1M bot, 1M media, 1M data miner for hedge fund... we still...??? 8-1-1-1= maybe 5M😅degenerates...

So heck if the 5M of us buy 1 share.... it make something.... and we know some of us got much more buying power... (for the SEC fuck you this is not
Manipulation, no financial advise it’s just a fucking obvious observation) 

That beeing said if we 💎🙌🏻 even if the short is 50% that 50% will hold like us and pay rising interest on their short until they say FUCK THOses retards we’re out and THEY BUY BACK THE SHARES... poping the price ⬆️ 🆙...  it’s not gonna have the same impact as a GME situation at 150%... BUT STILL...


TL DR... if you want to win don’t be like Davey and 🧻🤚... just hold and be patient and PLEASE ONLY GAMBLE MONEY YOU CAN LOOSE... 

Positions 3 GME share to be part of this at 110$

I believe more into AMC as a whole the squeeze and the AMC story... so 300 shares around 10$ and calls for march!

I joined around September of this year, and this community has brought me more joy than pretty much anything in my life. I've made some really good trades and some very bad ones, but one thing is certain, I have acquired invaluable knowledge in my time reading DD and from making mistakes. Now here is some information I would like to impart on all of you.

**DON'T LISTEN TO BEARS OR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO SKIN IN THE GAME**

Remember, we are betting against bears, and we have a thesis contrary to them. This isn't a platform where everybody shares ideas and grows together. Yes there are people willing to help, but at a certain level, there will come a point where you make your own trades based on your own DD. If you did the proper research, you should trust your gut. Many people will shit on you, especially when it looks like you're going to lose, but that's just the way life goes. The road to heaven is paved through miles of clouded hell.

**DID ANYTHING CHANGE TO MAKE YOUR POSITION SEEM INCORRECT? NO? STOP FUCKING PANICKING!**

This is just like the time in The Big Short when Michael Scott and Co. are screaming at Ryan Gosling for upping premiums on their short position. Nobody knows what the fuck is going on at the highest level. This level of criminality is parallel to what happened from 2001-2008. I'm so confident in my position that I'm not even considering selling. Everything is so fucking complex right now, and when things are unclear or murky, there is likely fraud going on.

**BANKING DEREGULATION HAS GONE ON SINCE THE FUCKING REAGAN ADMINISTRATION**

Imagine that. We now live in a world where shitheads like us were banging rocks together at one point and now make millions of dollars to bang boulders together. Wall Street didn't get smarter, they just managed to get the feds to stop looking.

\[ROCKET EMOJI\]

Please guys, I beg of you, do not sell your position (unless you went full retard and bet your rent). At this point, we have nothing to lose, and they have everything to lose. Remember, Monke hold banana if banana no poison Monke. Silverback who try to poison banana cannot poison banana that Monke not give to Gorilla.

Trust in Mark Cuban. Trust your fellow bulls. Hear the arguments of bears and do research to refute it. A strong argument needs to hold water against a counterargument. Good luck everyone, I'll see you on the fucking moon.

Edit: Why can't I see any of the fucking comments. ALSO I SAID DO RESEARCH NOT LOOK INTO THE ECHO CHAMBER. BEARS DO HAVE POINTS THAT NEED TO BE DISPROVEN

1612399893.0,75,Personal Risk Tolerance,"Hello degenerates,

Some of you may have read my last posts regarding investing in BB long term as well as other stocks that dipped during GME’s rise. Well today I want to take some time to add some wrinkles to your smooth brains. This wrinkle is called the Stop Loss and is probably missing from most of you 8,000,000+ wsb subscribers.

I probably need to preface this post since a lot of you probably can’t focus (or read) long enough to get past this section. I am NOT telling you to sell your GME shares. I think this entire event has been glorious and unprecedented in its cooperation across the world. That being said, I am simply providing information to those people who cannot handle the losses they may be risking by investing in the BANG gang.

Many, okay most of you, are holding GME, NOK, BB, or AMC. With their erratic price movement, you should have an out. I personally don’t trade without a stop loss, but then again, I am not a diamond-handed ape and like to control my losses.

This is how a stop loss works in simple terms:

1. monkey buys share for $100 each.
2. Monkey then creates a sell order, but instead of using “limit” or “market”, the monkey selects “Stop Loss” or “Stop on Quote” and types in the lowest price they are willing to sell
3. Confirm order

Congrats, you set up a stop loss and are a savvy trader.

“Oh, but why would I buy high sell low?” Well, you can answer to your own god why you bought high. The real reason for entering this order is to prevent further bleeding than you can handle.

It is impossible to browse WSB without seeing some form of loss porn coupled with “I didn’t hear no bell” or “IM NOT FUCKING SELLING.” That’s great and all, but for those smaller fish who need to pay rent or are risking their student loans (yeah, you Mr. dental school), I encourage using this safety net.

First, figure out what you are comfortable losing. If that is 20%, great use that. If you have GME with an average of $100 per share (not impossible based on today’s price movement), set your Stop Loss order for $80. Now, if GME drops below $80, congrats you got out and wont risk bleeding down to wherever it ends up. (note: this order is only active during regular trading hours. You are on your own afterhours).

“But Mr. Tacos, what if it bounces back?!” yeah that happens, but hey this is gambling, nothing is a sure thing. Be safe, invest smart, and always have an exit strategy. If you are a diamond handed ape willing to ride it to $0, may you have a spot reserved in stock-Valhalla (or the WSB hall of losses). If not? Well then, I hope this information helps.

(this is not financial advice)

TL;DR – Stop Loss good. Max Loss Bad.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Your comments reveal how little a lot of you know about trading. Sure, trading on volatile stocks like the BANG gang isn't going to be as effective as on something like SPY. That being said, the idea of ""only invest what you are willing to lose"" is completely misapplied here. 

If you are will to lose $1000, that does not mean you are limited to investing $1000. How about you invest $5000 and set a stop loss at $4000. Same loss, but much higher potential gains. "

It seems like a lifetime, or at least a Main Era—the kind of peak that never comes again. Wall Street Bets in the middle of January was a very special time and place to be a part of. Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run . . . but no explanation, no mix of loss porn or memes or 💎 ✋or 🚀 can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and YOLOing in that corner of your wife's boyfriend's basement. Whatever it meant. . . .

Tendies are hard to know, because of all the hired bullshit, but even without being sure of “tendies” it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the energy of all the autists and retards comes to a head in a long fine short squeeze, for memes that nobody really understands at the time—and which never explain, in retrospect, what actually happened.

My central memory of that time seems to hang on one or five or maybe forty threads—or very early mornings shitposts—when I checked WSB half-crazy and, instead of cashing out, aimed the big $1650 Robinhood account towards GameStop at $325 per share, wearing cummed-stained shorts and a ramen-stained shirt. . .chucking rent money into AMC at $16 per share, not quite sure what my exit strategy was (always stalling at the sell button, too autistic to take profits while I fumbled for more YOLO money) . . . but being absolutely certain that no matter which way I traded I would come to a place where people were just as retarded and 💎 ✋ed as I was: No doubt at all about that. . . .

There was madness in any stonk, at any hour. If not across GME, then in AMC or BB or NOK. . . . You could strike tendies anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. . . .

And that, I think, was the handle—that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Boomers and Hedge Funds. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn’t need that. Our autism would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting—on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of GameStop, a high and beautiful wave. . . .

So now, less than a week later, you can go up a steep chart on Robinhood and scroll back, and with the right kind of autism you can almost see the high-water price—that place at $500 per share where the wave finally broke and rolled back."
1612399446.0,103,I fear they are going to tank the market and blame WSB squeezing GME,"Obligatory not financial advice. I know nothing and am 🌈🐻 that has not made up for losses since March last year.

Imagine you are uber-egotistical douche who stands to lose a lot on a ""should-die-cause-I-say-so"" company due to internet retards after illegally short selling more shares than there are. But that's ok, you practically own the MM Castle HQ and can do whatever you want. How to get out of this mess? Buy back the shares at a loss? LOLOLOL nah.

Step 0 - Just don't deliver the shares. Got friends in the right places so just do what you want. Oh the internet retards are saying there will be a squeeze and twitter just exploded. Time to be more active. Guess I'll go after a bigger fish.

Step 1 - Sell tons of massively high IV options on gaming company to build some quick free capital. Then sell some megacaps (especially those tech stocks that just had an absurd year). Make sure to do it quickly to really bring the price down. Funding secured.

Step 2 - Force price of gaming company down. Stop retail from trading and use some good ole fashioned short laddering to clear out the stop losses and paper hands. At same time, sow FUD using news buddies. Wait a second, why don't I have my big bank buddy from a few years back dangle something shiny in front of everyone (AND have tell everyone the internet retards love it) to divide and conquer?

Step 3 - Buy tons of the artificially dropped calls for cheap. A ton that expire the same week, and some more out over next few months. Same week is good because as MM I have fail to deliver rules of T+6 instead of T+3 so timing is the Friday after options expire.

Step 4- Bring the general market back up and hold it steady at close to, but slightly lower than, the prior high. This will drop volatility enough to buy a bunch of general market puts and volatility calls while still signaling to TA nerds that we could head back down with this double/triple top.

Step 5- Run the gaming company price back up. Internet retards will think its start of squeeze and pile on. Price will skyrocket again and at same time dump tons of those mega caps. Make it look like having to dump big names to buy back shitty company shares.

Step 6- Once it hits the right level, exercise the lowest cost calls to grab enough shares to at least cover delivery needs for cheap. Sell higher cost calls for even more absurd IVs. Longer dated calls should help with next few rounds of delivery; should buy enough time for this to fade. It will look like squeeze took place so even most of those internet retards will be out.

Step 7- Dump the megacaps again. TA nerds and HFT bots will keep it going. Profit off all the fear generated in the general market about impact of squeeze - always a bigger fish. Sell all those megacap puts for profit before buying back megacap shares until back up to level from step 1 at a discount. Or teach them all a lesson, by switching over into cash and safe assets and letting the market fall. Will get the news buddies on blaming those internet retards...

1612397329.0,16323,"The anatomy of a Short Escalator Omega Overflow attack - why GME’s real price is $2,147,483,737","Hey diamond hands,

as I am sure you have heard, there are rumors that short ladder attacks are being used to suppress the price of GME. While I held this belief for many days, I am now beginning to realize that even more insidious and backhanded techniques are being used against us. I mean seriously, there is simply no reasonable explanation for why a stock should drop in price. None.

The good news is that Melvin is more scared than ever. The bad news is that today was no short ladder attack. No, it was far worse.

Today we experienced a Short Escalator Omega Overflow attack

Most people here have at least a few days of investing experience under their belts, so I'm not going to dumb down these concepts for you. If you can understand a short ladder attack, you can understand this tactic as well.

Basically, a Short Escalator Omega Overflow attack (or Overflow attack for short) is the opposite of a short ladder attack. In a short ladder attack, shares are traded back and forth, with each trade a penny lower. In an overflow attack, the attack chooses to instead trade shares to an accomplice at incredibly high prices. How high you ask?

$2,147,483,648

That's right, hedge funds have been selling single shares for billions of dollars right behind our backs. Why this price though? It's simple.

Every investment app, RH, TD, etc, use 32 bit integers to store prices. The maximum value of a 32 bit integer is 2,147,483,647. So what happens when it goes up by one? It goes negative.

This means that every share in an overflow attack is worth:  -$2,147,483,647

What do you think this does to the price of a stock? If you answered bad things, you are correct. The sale of one of these shares is enough to send the price of a stock far into the negatives. Didn't think that stocks could go negative? I'm not surprised - that's another hedge fund secret. They don't tell you THAT on investopedia!

But as the critical thinkers you are, I'm sure you will now ask:

""Why isn't the stock price negative right now?""

The answer is because the squeeze is happening RIGHT NOW. Paper hands laughed at the idea of an infinity squeeze, but it happened and it was big. So big in fact that it overflowed the price itself.

MATH TIME

So we know that GME overflowed in the squeeze. But by how much? Well we know that the price right now is $90. But we have to take the overflow squeeze into consideration.

If there is -$2,147,483,557 of pressure on prices, then to reach $90 the stock must cost 2,147,483,647 + 90, or $2,147,483,737. Yes.

EACH SHARE OF GME IS CURRENTLY WORTH $2,147,483,737

We can't forget about overflow however, so the price stored in your brokerage account is actually -$1,073,741,734. Now this might sounds like a scary number, but as long as you didn't buy on margin you will be fine. As long as you keep holding, the SEC will be FORCED to do something about it. They are already under extreme pressure to help retail investors - it's only a matter of time.

And as a side note: If for some reason Melvin stops this overflow attack, your stocks will be worth over a billion negative dollars. At this point, buying GME makes a profit whereas selling puts the next 10 generations of you family into debt enslavement. So as the wise investors on WSB say: BUY!

WE DESERVE OUR BILLIONS

Volume short: 9638240 
Tot Volume: 17735739

54% shorts

If we assume the same ration for real total volume (higher than the one reported to FINRA)
That's around 22.7 M shares short today

If we assume that any other transaction was a cover then:
New shorts (not covered) = 3.5 M

The data since 27/01 is more than 50% every day. Meaning more shorts overall. 

It's still possible Melvin is out (at least partially)
It's still possible that they are covering old shorts with new one (like cover a short at 30$ keeping open one at 90$, or averaging up), new shorts are supposed to be more expensive in term of interests though

Very basic DD, consider the assumptions though.

TL;DR 
Short positions are likely to be increasing since the 27/01 according to FINRA daily data.

I’m not that convinced. EV/Sales 45% higher than EA and TTWO. 

WoW Classic didn’t quite have the meteoric rise I thought it would. But I’ve heard great things about Shadowlands, but I think the MMO genre is fading a bit. But the money is so good.

And does Call of Duty really have that bright a future versus other FPS? Fortnite has Gen Z, CS:GO the purists, and Apex seems like it’s the closest thing to a Halo title. 

So let’s talk about what ATVI really is then, a mobile game company.

That’s where the money is, that’s how they support this valuation. The risk to consumer preferences is so high. Unless you all tell me you all play ATVI titles. 

Mike Morhaime started Dreamhaven, poaching Blizzard OGs, and really just about their whole hiring pool I would imagine.

Is the tide turning? I think so, but I could be wrong. Because mobile gaming is basically like a casino and it goes brrrrrr to shareholders.

1612395918.0,97,"DD on $TSM, a play on the auto industry Semiconductor Shortage.","I work at a hyundai dealer, our corporate a month ish ago sent us links to articles about the coming semiconductor shortage in the auto industry. The shortage is forcing many manufacturers to hault or slow productions. This was technically good news for us as hyundai dealer as hyundai manufacturers their own and wont be effected. 

The shortage has affected Volkswagen, Ford Motor Co, Subaru Corp, Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co Ltd, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and other car makers. 

But why should we autists care about this shortage, Ticker $TSM. 

Now, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, ticker $TSM has only dipped their toes into supplying for the auto industry. 3% of sales were related to the auto industry in 2020. They are being pushed by these manufacturers to change routes to help supply for this shortage. 

From the article, ""In 2020, auto chips accounted only for 3% of TSMC's sales, lagging smartphones' 48% and 33% for high performance chips.
In the fourth quarter, sales for TSMC's auto chips jumped 27% from the previous quarter, but still only accounted for 3% of overall sales in the quarter."" ""Germany has asked Taiwan to persuade Taiwanese manufacturers to help ease a shortage of semiconductor chips in the auto sector which is hampering its fledgling economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.""
""The ministry told Reuters that it had received requests from both the United States and the European Union through ""diplomatic channels"" late last year, as well as from Germany and Japan this year.""

1612395625.0,11,You enjoy watching xQc / Shroud / Ninja / TheStockGuy? You think live streaming has a bright future? Read this DD about $HUYA,"Long time twitch viewer, long time investor, 1 year old WSB member lurker. I'm a millenial and have been in the stock market for about 5 years. POGCHAMP.

Twitch is the north american leader of live streaming and I would love to invest in it. Here is the problem: Amazon owns twitch, therefore if you want to invest in twitch, you need to pay for amazon shares. Twitch is a drop in the ocean.

The only equivalent companies I have found are $HUYA and $DOYU which are both live streaming leaders in china.

&#x200B;

**BOOMERS have actually shorted $HUYA stock for 35% of the floating shares.** I guarantee you that the shorting boomers don't have the slightest fucking clue how the business model of live streaming platforms work. They don't understand the strong sense of community that twitch builds upon and why people would donate money willingly to their favorite streamers. I have seen the twitch viewers grow from the past years and I don't see it stopping anytime soon considering millenials are growing older and so is Gen Z.

&#x200B;

I know that nobody cares about fundamentals these days but just look at those numbers:

HUYA sales in 2016 (In Millions of CNY): 796.904

HUYA sales in 2019 (In Millions of CNY): 8,374.501

&#x200B;

The growth of live streaming platforms is absolutely insane and I believe it is the future instead of regular T.V. The market cap of $HUYA is only 6.1 Billion$ which makes it even more attractive for WSB buyers if they decide to like the stock. Considering the huge spike of interest in the stock market by the younger generation, and the fact that AOC had 300k concurrent viewers on twitch when she was talking about the $GME saga. It shows the bright future of this industry all over the world.

&#x200B;

Also, the gaming giant Tencent ($TCEHY) owns shares of $HUYA so this literally can't go tits up.

&#x200B;

THE RISKS OF THIS INVESTMENT

&#x200B;

IMO, the real risk of this investment would be the content restrictions that can be imposed at anytime by the chinese government.

It doesn't concern me too much because even though they can decide to ban video games at any time, people still feel a strong sense of community with a particular streamer. 

At some point people do not even care for what video games their favorite streamer decides to play. A good example would be the streamer xQc on the twitch platform. 

My man can play overwatch/valorant and even chess. He will retain an average of 70k+ viewers every single time.

# ***No. We can not.*** 

That's market manipulation. **It's not even a good idea;** if you mean to play a short squeeze, every sale you make is a chance to let a short cover - and other reasons that's a flawed idea - but that's not my point. 

Yeah. We're all making our own decisions here, It's not wrong to discuss why we made them. 

**What we're not permitted to do is manipulate prices.** Some of the hedgies are used to doing it because they're not documenting themselves in the public eye like WSB is.

#Update:      
There have been institutional players liquidating positions, too. I just read a (somewhat condescending) WSJ piece featuring a couple of long-side firms who were using the spike to take profits on a $700M position they opened in September. 

Not everything that looks like manipulation truly ***is*** manipulation.  Dropping single lots at a time would be the thing to do if you wanted to avoid crushing prices all at once with your huge wad of shares.

1612395199.0,369,GME: Looking at Some Data!,"Let's look at some charts again and try to figure out what went on today. Before that, I just want to make sure people understand that I'm just looking at some data and \*guessing\* what is happening. I do that mainly for myself because I don't fully trust anyone's judgment and I want to be in charge of my decisions. I could be wrong! I think you should do to same: try to gather as much information as possible, process that information, and make up your mind! If you lose money this way (instead of following people blindly), at least you learn from your mistakes.

Let's jump into it: Based on the position-cost distribution from today (from Webull), I see that [yesterday's pattern](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbc5gq/gmes_data_irregularities/) happened again: there was a decent amount of shares added to the float, take a look:

[Position Cost Distribution Comparison: 2\/2 vs 2\/3](https://i.redd.it/xdl3jjnbfcf61.gif)

Today's change, however, is slightly different: as you can see, it looks like a relatively small amount of shares went from below $92 to above it. This could be due to either some profit-taking, day-trading, or scalping.  Note that stock price went up but ""Total Profited Shares Proportion"" is slightly down because of both of these (short selling as soon as price went up, and some profit-taking/day trading/scalping). I personally think that the bigger pattern is the new shares that seem to be added to the float and there has been a lot of short selling activity in the past two days:

[2\/1 vs 2\/2 vs 2\/3](https://i.redd.it/4ohs95ingcf61.gif)

Where are they getting these shares from? I have no idea!

Another thing that keeps happening (I posted about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laqa34/gme_evidence_of_short_seller_collusion_for_months/) the first time I noticed) is that I see a lot (what looks to be fake) orders with weird numbers. I don't know what these are (they don't look real, but I also doubt that they are just a glitch) and my previous guess (explained in a previous post) was probably wrong because today I saw this:

[Weird orders with very high SP](https://preview.redd.it/spb6cfqrhcf61.jpg?width=2732&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9d5c101eb9b9d6d83cd9e3926dc540cc02bf1bb)

So if anyone has a plausible explanation for these weird orders, please let me know!

PS. There are massive open interests on both put and call options that expire this Friday, so things might get extremely volatile again!

1612394686.0,158,US Marijuana Legalization: the next rocket catalyst,"**Bubbles**
An emergence of a new industry usually results in a bubble due to the necessity of making a lot of assumptions about future growth to value a stock since there is no historical precedent. The enthusiasm for a paradigm shift causes investors to frequently overshoot and result in what may be quite astronomical valuations. Currently, the US equities market is quite frothy with unprecedented loose monetary policy causing an asset bubble of historic proportions. Jeremy Graham calls the US equities the biggest bubble he has ever seen in his investing career.  With the Democrats in charge of government, the corresponding stimulus bill will result in a melt up of the stock market along with risky equities. 

**Government Involvement** 
Government policy and actions can ignite a bubble. Chinese EV stocks were in the dumps during March 2020 due to the Covid shut downs, and the curtailment by the Chinese government of EV subsidies. NIO was on the verge of bankruptcy with only having enough cash to sustain its payrolls for 2 months at the time. But the subsequent 180 from the government for EV subsidies along with a partnership with a local government entity caused NIO to skyrocket. 

We are already in an environment of risk seeking, frothy environment where a value play of a struggling retailer can turn into a short squeeze that ends up as a social moment. This is a crazy market, and it will get even crazier when Congress legalizes marijuana.

US marijuana legalization efforts has followed a similar path to gay marriage where the public opinion over the decade has shifted due to states leading the way for legalization followed by an increasingly favorable depiction in popular culture that has shifted public opinion. I believe we are on the verge of legalization now that the Democrats hold all positions of power in government, and they are willing to pass progressive policies after getting stung in the Obama administration for trying to negotiate a “bipartisan” path that went nowhere.  

**Political Calculus**
The House has already passed HR 3884 MORE Act of 2020 that pretty much legalized marijuana. Schumer who is the current Senate Majority Leader, sponsored the S 1552 Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act in 2019, but it went nowhere since McConnell ran the show at the time. Legal marijuana is Schumer’s pet legislation he has been pushing for years, and he is under pressure to enact progressive legislation due to threats of other progressives running against him in the 2022 primary. He will most likely push to get it passed in the Senate before his primary so that he can parade it in his re-election campaign and kill any progressive challenges to his seat. 

Marijuana stocks have done well since the election, but I think they have more room to go due to the following reasons. Once legalization happens, a couple of things happen. 

1.    **Institutional money.** US banks and institutional investors cannot invest in a company that produces a product that is federally illegal. However, once legalization happens, the barrier no longer applies. You will have a flood of institutional funds buying up companies operating in a grey zone (hence my preference for US based MSOs compared to more mainstream Canadian companies). 

2.	**Taxes.** Currently, IRS does not allow medical marijuana companies to deduct their business expenses so most of them are operating at a loss despite 50-70% gross margin. Once marijuana is legalized, their tax bill will no longer cause them to operate at a loss. 

3.	**Availability.** US MSO who have the biggest to gain from this are trading in Canadian stock exchanges in a quasi-grey area. Once they become legalized, they can move into main stream stock exchanges like NYSE which can open them up to retail investors to trade in. 

4.	**Financing.** The best US MSO can only get a 10% rate for their financing needs in order to expand due to the lack of banks willing to do business with them because of the ambiguity in the federal guidelines. When the restriction is lifted, their financing costs will go down and their payment processing fees/ availability will improve. 

TLDR- US based weed stocks going to the moon. Diamond hands for tendies."

1612393887.0,168,Don't trade on margin if you want to have diamond hands,"Margin is alluring because it gives you control of money you do not have. But keep in mind that you are borrowing money from your broker with interest, and the broker will liquidate your position if you fall below a threshold, e.g., 33%, 50%, etc., depending on your broker. If you are margin called, some brokers will call you and give you time to add additional funds (which you may not have) or liquidate your positions before they are force liquidated. However, if you look into the contractual language between you and your broker, they are NOT obligated to give you a heads up. Moreover, given that they are likely bombarded right now, and probably have an incentive to liquidate your positions, they are mostly likely allowed to manually liquidate your position, e.g., your GME long positions. You cannot diamond hand a position that is manually liquidated by your broker. 

Some of you may say that you cant even go on margin on GME. That is true for some brokers. If you want to trade GME, don't go on margin trying to trade any other equity. Do not give your broker a chance to liquidate your positions.
