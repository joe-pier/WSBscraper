1615672260.0,35,New $BB Partnership - Heavy Truck Autonomous Driving,"[Plus.ai](https://Plus.ai), > $1bn valuation (likely more now w/ the interest in the sector) autonomous driverless truck  company, recently announced that it would equip its systems [w/ NVIDIA](https://www.thetrucker.com/trucking-news/equipment-tech/self-driving-truck-tech-developer-plus-to-launch-next-gen-system-for-heavy-duty-trucks).

Buried in the release - Apparently it also recently partnered with $BB for QNX **and** AWS. Some of you may have already seen this but this was news to me.

Saw a lot about partnerships from Blackberry with OEMs but one of the criticisms from the laymen is that its software has been around a while with old school manufacturers like GM / Ford (implying it's stale) - It says a lot that a cutting edge domestic autonomous driving business l[eads with $BB QNX](https://www.autofutures.tv/2020/11/17/plus-chooses-blackberry-to-power-its-automated-driving-system-for-heavy-duty-trucks/).

In addition - We all know electtric vehicles and autonomous driving is hot. But of all the applications, long-haul trucking, where routes are defined and largely over monotonous, consistent highway, are probably going to be the soonest to be completely disrupted.

TLDR - Man I love this stock. $BB to the mooooooooon!! But in a steady, safe, and responsible fashion, as Papa Chen would want."

Excluding retail the % held by insiders + the % held by institutions (mostly passive funds, ETFs, etc) is around 150%. 

They simply can't close all position. Insiders won't sell that much. Institutions are mostly passively managed, thus more diamond hands than us apes.

If we add retail we may get some % points of diamond handing. 

THEY BROKE THE SYSTEM, THEY CAN'T CLOSE ALL OF THE SHORTS.

TL;DR
