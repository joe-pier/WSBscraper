Greetings and salutations strangers of the inter-webs.

Like most people with ARK heavy portfolios, Ive been taking a beating these last 2 months. Debating on whether or not to wait it out (which Im willing to do) or if its a better idea to shift some things around. So of course Im looking for the opinions of random people on a stock sub-reddit for highly valuable feedback.

1619026175.0,6,"CLOV the possibility of a Gamma Squeeze! We are here to make money, so stop the hate.","Hi, apes

&#x200B;

So since the wrong SI% of float report came out, lots and lots of calls have been bought. Just to mention it, the SI% of the float is still very high, around 39% according to S3Partners. This now leads us to a very interesting case, a Gamma squeeze. Be aware to reach a Gamma squeeze the stock price first needs to go up to where these enormous amounts of calls are. A catalyst could trigger a surge in the stock price, leading to a huge amount of calls being ITM, forcing naked call sellers to buy back shares.

**What is a gamma squeeze?**

""The **gamma squeeze** happens when the underlying stock's price begins to go up very quickly within a short period of time. As more money flows into call options from investors, that forces more buying activity which can lead to higher stock prices""

&#x200B;

Down below is a picture of the option chain of CLOV:

&#x200B;

There are 304657 calls OTM up to strike $30. This is over 30m shares to be executed if the price goes above $30 on May 21st. In other words, this is around 28% of the entire public float. This reminds me a lot of the good old days on GME were lots and lots of calls were bought, and then the thing exploded and all calls ended ITM creating a gamma squeeze! The same could happen on CLOV if the price goes high enough.

&#x200B;

The thing is, with this many calls and such a high SI% of float shorties would have trouble covering their short positions. 40m+ shares are sold short. 30m+ shares would be ITM if the stock price goes above $30. The public float is only 109m shares. The largest shareholder is Vanguard with 26m shares, which brings the float down to 83m shares!

Sorry for the short DD, but I haven't seen a DD on here explaining this scenario

Position: 116x $10 calls expiring May 21st.

And just for the sake of it, this is not financial advice"
1619025874.0,4,Why I am shorting GoPro (GPRO),"Let me start off by saying I am a huge fan of GoPro and have been since the release of the GoPro Hero 2. 

But although I like the product and the GoPro Hero 9 is my current go-to action camera, the stock price far overvalues the company. The stock saw around a 520% increase to the peak of recent prices from last March. What justified this increase in price? 

GoPro’s recent turn to selling subscriptions and their high 2020 subscriber counts was the good news for investors. They had a total of 760,000 subscribers by the end of 2020,  a 145% increase in subscriptions from the previous year.  Those who follow this company closely know that this increase in subscription price was due to the release of the GoPro Hero 9 and the promotion of $200 off a bundle package with the purchase of a GoPro subscription. Users know that the grammar of the subscription details was very sketchy and it was unclear if users could immediately cancel their subscription after purchase without being charged the $200 they saved because they didn’t hold their subscription for a whole year. Their subscription numbers hold just based on their GoPro Hero 9 release, few GoPro users turn to GoPro for accessories. Most GoPro users will go online where they can purchase an accessory mount from a different brand for more than 70% cheaper. GoPro’s strength in versatility has always relied on third party gear for custom mounts and specialized attachments. GoPro users who are looking to mod out their GoPro with a mic, ND filters, or stands, turn to companies such as Rode, Polar Pro, or other companies that are cheaper and higher quality than the modifications GoPro provides.

The company also turned to its Quik app to attract anyone who does video and photo editing/storing, not just GoPro users. GoPro has always been releasing apps but the apps themselves were finicky and never worth using from my experience. It will definitely be interesting to see the report on the success of the app when the company reports its earnings on May 6th.

As a GoPro user, as much as I like the company, I see that the product line is stagnant. GoPro releases one new camera a year (plus the MAX) and it’s users can barely justify the upgrade due to minimal change between models. Many youtubers and influencers commonly tell consumers to wait for the next model to upgrade since differences aren’t very significant. GoPro’s latest release was a pair of floating black sunglasses. They have tried multiple times in the past to get into lifestyle gear and it never caught on with their consumer base but they continue to release lifestyle gear, an indicator of how little the company is focusing on change. The moat of GoPro used to be HUGE but now, every other company has an action camera that is cheaper, similar in design, and often does more than what the GoPro offers (DJI, InstaOne, Garmin). 

The company is stuck on its GoPro Hero line and for the most part it is trapped. It tried to expand into making drones but DJI snuffed them out quick. It relies too much on third parties to provide accessories for the users that their accessories don’t make them enough revenue. Their software apps have always been substandard. GoPro is not a long term hold and I would argue they are not a short term one either. Earnings report on May 6th!"
1619024523.0,1,(AHCO) analysis mid cap stock that massively undervalued,"Hello Reddit I would like to post an analysis on (AHCO) this company came across my screener last Friday where I then wrote a report in slid show format (easy for work). I am rather bullish on the stock and I get bore bullish on it by the day. I should mention though i dod not put it in my report, the premiums for call contracts are insanely low, I have ran the numbers for me if it his the levels it was trading at call contracts could see 600-700% returns, consivertivly i peg the returns at 50-100%, but its a matter of how one holds. (when trading on anything I say it is your discretion and risk, it is not my responsibility if you loose money on this trade should you put money on it)  


Also forgive any poor spelling, I havent been sleeping well and I have been drinking (work relates stress). But I hope at least a few of you enjoy

1619013622.0,0,HUYA Arbitrage Opportunity Waiting to Explode,"Fellow degenerates, this is not the DD that you deserve but it is the DD that I can provide. Please, funnier/smarter people enter the fray here.

At this point I am sure many of you have stumbled across HUYA. There is obvious arbitrage at play and this is ripe for opportunity. Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) aka the KING MAKER is behind the HUYA and DOYU merger. HUYA and DOYU account for 80% of the online video game streaming market in China. This match made in heaven has two headwinds:

1. Regulatory pressures from the Chinese government. The face of this is of course BABA and that was resolved recently with a fat $2.8 BILLION fine. This is great news because the situation is no longer stagnant and the Chinese corporate underlords have publicly stated that they will comply and concede where needed to appease the big man XI XI. One such company that openly kneeled compliantly is Tencent.
2. DOYU is embroiled in some online gambling suspicions and it looks valid. This is a very short-run headwind so gimme dat stock at a discount, thank you for the bad press.

Big money and smart people are going long on DOYU shares and shorting HUYA because if the merger goes through DOYU = .75 HUYA shares. **33% Short Interest right now.** This is the arbitrage. Artificially suppressing HUYA and inflating DOYU shares. There are two ways this shakes out:

1. The merger goes through and there is a super concentrated powerhouse that dominates 80% of the Chinese video game streaming company. This is an extremely bullish industry in the biggest market on the planet. YES PLEASE
2. The merger does not go through and the arbitrage falls apart. At that point the shorts stop shorting HUYA and sell their DOYU shares and HUYA springs like a fucking rocket. YES PLEASE.

This is a win win. The fundamentals of HUYA are amazing. The fundamentals of DOYU are fine. Do your DD on the fundamentals and think about this arbitrage play. Merger could close by the end of 2nd quarter 2021 so pretty soon. It could also be drawn out as Tencent makes concessions in negotiations with the Chinese government. This is not financial advise. I am a moron.

Disclosure: I have 40 HUYA call options expiring Jan 2023 at a 20 strike price with an average price of 5.67 (I just bought some right now for 5). I will continue to buy as this goes down."

1. We start with a short fundamental analysis

\-Nintendo has liabilities of round about 32,5$ per share

\-on the other hand there are 119,5$ equity

that means we have 87$ assets per share (we can subtract this amount for the further analysis, because this value is available in assets)

one share cost round about 580$ - 87$(in assets) we get a price of 493$

If we use the predicted earnings for next year, we've got a PE-ratio of 15,5.

That's a normal PE-ratio for a Japanese Share, but what are the hidden values of Nintendo (in my opinion)?

As many of us, I was watching YouTube Videos in the Corona-Time. And I got addicted to Pokemon Booster openings. In this context I realized, that my generation, has a big emotional bond to Nintendo products. Nintendo still hold's the license for popular franchises like Pokemon and Mario Kart. The amounts of money, that flew, just for very old products of this franchise, give u a roughly estimate, of how big, the value actually is.

It is leading the tech industry in 5G in South [Asia](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/blackberry-will-power-baidu-technology-for-future-chinese-evs/); BB has partnerships with tech giants like Baidu--- securing a contract to run Baidu's mapping tech on their infrastructure for autonomous vehicles -- a partnership that will pay dividends as that market is only projected to grow in the future. I ask again why do Boomers hate BB? I don't fucking know.

Not to mention, BB has a very respected and competent CEO who in my opinion is being [overpaid](https://financialpost.com/investing/blackberry-ceo-chen-gets-128-million-award-to-continue-revival), but has the potential to bring the stock to 30.00 by the end of this year.  He has a proven track [record](https://www.canadianbusiness.com/leadership/blackberry-ceo-john-chen-turnaround-interview/).

oh, and by the way, BB is not a fucking smart phone company. At least not anymore. Maybe this is why they are not respected?

*And based on the EPV valuation it is a woapping* **$86.23**   

**VIAC offers a unique opportunity to take advantage of a current market in-efficiency.**   
As we all know by now a series of events lead to Archegos getting margin called. The Archegos fund was extremely aggressive and was operating under 5x leverage, heavily concentrating on Chinese and Media Stocks, such as BAIDU, BILI, TCEHY, IQ, VIAC, DISCA. There are many articles that explain how this margin call came to be. I won’t be discussing it here, because I want to discuss the opportunity this presents.

Whether you think Paramount + is good or not. I still think there is still an opportunity to cash in on VIAC’s assets. VIAC has a strong balance sheet and many assets that are valuable in the content business regardless if Paramount + takes off or not. Let’s address the elephants in the room. Can Paramount + compete with the top players like NFLX, DIS, or even HBO MAX?
I don’t think it matters if they can successfully compete or not because they have a huge library of content they can sell licences on and this makes them a valuable target to be acquired by the likes of AAPL or AMZN who are trying to pave their way into the streaming business. Their main revenue driver is cable television and everybody is cutting the cord these days so this is a shrinking segment, this does pose a risk to their recurring revenue. However they have another valuable asset that will help them offset this risk, and that is live sports. Although cable TV is shrinking, sports is definitely not and VIAC has many contracts and rights to stream live sports on their Paramount + service. None of the top 3 streaming services I mentioned does live sports streaming, and I’m sure they would love to add live sports on their library of contents. Their only competitor in the live sports segment FUBO. I do not perceive FUBO as a threat yet as they’re extremely overvalued and the business is losing money and has a lot of catching up to do. Even if FUBO is acquired before VIAC does, the acquisition of FUBO will force the other large streaming service to try and acquire their own to compete.

**The Valuation:**

I will present you with 3 different valuation all of them assume Paramount + is a flop and does not take off so I assume zero growth on their streaming service.   

Scenario one: Bullcase, I assume they will grow their total revenue by 3-5% for the next 5 year.  
[Revenue Estimates](https://imgur.com/78x276u).  
[DCF Valuation](https://imgur.com/s6TOmhj)

Scenario two: Bearcase, I assume their total revenue will be shrinking by  (-) 7-3%.  
[Revenue Calculations](https://imgur.com/JUWIXuz).  
[DCF Valuation](https://imgur.com/gra7R5E).  

Scenario three: I used an old school valuation method to value the business, Earning Power Value (EPV). In the EPV method it takes away the requirement for trying to predict the future and only takes into account the present business earning power. This method of valuation assumes no growth to the business. This method of valuation is a good valuation metric for valuing mature non growing businesses.   
[EPV Valuation](https://imgur.com/un2fh7u)

**Conclusion:**

Even in a declining environment VIAC is still fairly valued at **$37.83**.  
And in a bullish environment VIAC is fairly valued at **$65.26**.  
And based on the EPV valuation it is a woapping **$86.23**. 

This is not financial advice. I'm an ape"
1618963804.0,13,NVAX - Likely my last update DD before reaching Callhalla,"I've made a few posts before this ( [1st Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq3ksw/nvax_dont_miss_this_perfect_vaccine_play_headed/),  [2nd Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/luuige/nvax_part_ii_last_call_before_a_shit_ton_of/), [3rd Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mlielu/nvax_i_liked_it_at_300_i_love_it_at_180/)) but I know it's alot to go through so I shall give a brief comprehensive summary here. Just a reminder none of this is financial advice, I am but a mere PhD student that has had the ride of their lives on this stock. My goal isn't to shill or hype but instead to sharpen the conviction of my fellow big-cojone'd NVAX bulls, to concentrate info from different sources, and to create a space for discussion and overleveraged speculation. I think this stock is done taking a shit, we have a good idea of lower bound supports, and we're ready to blow some loads with upcoming catalysts. I also have some current questions I'd like to get the input of the community on. So let's dig in!

**1) Why I believe in the technology**

Really recommend my first post for a more in-depth discussion on this but basically this vaccine is antigen-based which is a very standard tried-and-true modality often used in ""traditional"" vaccines like flu vaccines etc. What makes them special is they add a natural compound (an ""adjuvant"") that makes your immune system super responsive to the antigen. This adjuvant is actually a saponin that is harvested from soapbark trees that grow in Chile. The benefit of using this is that 1) old people and people with weak immune systems respond well and build immunity even with lower doses of antigen 2) you can make vaccines with small amounts of antigen which makes them much cheaper and MOST IMPORTANTLY 3) you can ""fit"" more antigen varieties into a single dose. There's only so much antigen you can inject into a person at once so with this technology you can have a single vaccine with flu AND several covid variant antigens as opposed to having to get a separate vaccine for each virus. Also since this vaccine is protein antigen based you can keep it at 4C (same temp you keep your beers) for months.

Additionally!!!!! We've seen alot of AMAZING efficacy and safety results from the UK and SA phase 1/2/3 trials and the US phase 1/2 trial (still waiting for phase 3 data to drop soon!). **This is one of the main reasons I remain so bullish.** The humongous unknown risk of efficacy/safety has been largely cleared and now we're just sifting through some other issues/bottlenecks/FUD that I will talk about below. Anyone that trades biotech stocks knows that safety/efficacy are the BIGGEST risk that can curb stomp a stock and we've cleared that in my opinion.

&#x200B;

**2) A brief history of this chart**

This is one of the wildest charts you'll find and I think it's incredibly important to understand what caused it to look like that so that you can get a better picture of where we're going.

**Sept 2016** \- Plummet from \~$150 to \~$25 came from their RSV vaccine getting poor efficacy results

**Feb 2019** \- Plummet from \~$40 to \~$10 came from them failing the RSV efficacy trials again lmao. HOWEVER things are looking up for RSV vaccine recently (this deserves its own DD honestly but you can read more about it [here](https://www.novavax.com/our-pipeline))

At this point you can see why investors had no faith in NVAX. It was beaten down like a rabid dog like Ziptrader Charlie would say. Enter covid left stage:

**May 2020** \- Gap up from \~$15 to \~$40 came from A) fantastic nano-Flu phase 3 results (their very own flu vaccine, shown to be better than the current state-of-the-art flu vaccines) which is basically their first big WIN and B) beginning of clinical trials for covid vaccine.

**Aug 2020** \- Gap up to $180 came from great phase 1/2 covid vaccine results! I remember these glory days. Too bad we then plummeted and became range bound in the $80-$100 range. This was caused by a combo of sell-the-news and competitor companies (MRNA, BNTX, JNJ, AZN) making fast progress.

**Feb 2021**  \- Gap up to $300 from phase 3 interim data coming from UK phase 3 trial. This was fantastic news! Best in class vaccine with stellar safety and 96% efficacy against original variant. 

**Mar 2021 - Present** \- We fell from grace and have been bouncing between $170 and $220. Lots of factors here but of course the March market madness did not help this low float stock. I vividly remember NVAX falling 10+% day after day during the worst of it. I kept buying the dip and now I'm jacked to the MF tits and not ready to sell even when we get nice 13% days here and there.

Notice anything so far about this chart? **It loves to gap up**. This is a low float stock and the market cap is comparably small compared to competitors like MRNA, JNJ, etc. It's not uncommon to see it almost double when BIG catalysts drop and trust me when I tell you we've got ALOT of big catalysts on the menu. We've recently found a ROCK HARD floor at $170 and most recently a very strong support at $200. This stock has been severely de-risked and I think right now is still a damn good time to buy because of this asymmetrical risk.

&#x200B;

**3) Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt - Bear case and the FUD spread by short sellers**

\-*NVAX is too late to the game. The entire world is vaccinated already. Pandemic is over.* This is obviously not true and I've written extensively about it in my 2nd and 3rd posts. India, home to 1.4 BILLION people has only vaccinated a little more than 1% of its vaccination. India is currently the epicenter of the pandemic with cases going parabolic recently sadly. It should also be noted that NVAX has a [deal](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-memorandum-understanding-gavi-cumulative) with the Gavi Institute in India to manufacture and deliver 1.1 Bn doses of covid vaccines. More on India a little further down the post. Additionally, new variants continue to pop up and it seems more and more like we'll be getting covid booster shots for a while.

\-*Insiders are selling so they know something is up*. This is so stupid don't fall for this trap. They've sold days before major catalysts in the past. Everything is scheduled ahead of time and from what I understand also has something to do with them exercising their options. Let's not even mention the fact that selling millions in stock right before you drop horrible news would be the most blatant illegal insider trading ever lol

\-*NVAX is having manufacturing issues. They're not gonna be able to produce the vaccines they promised, just look at what happened to the EU deal.* I wrote about this alot in my 3rd post. I was worried at first that the raw materials they were missing perhaps was the adjuvant that comes from the soapbark trees (yikes!) However, as it turns out [the problem is actually the supply of 2,000 liter plastic bags](https://www.fiercepharma.com/manufacturing/lack-grow-bags-a-hefty-problem-for-novavax-s-covid-19-vaccine-production-push) that they need to grow their cells. The bags exist but they're currently being locked up by the US as per the Defense Production Act. Literally the US is reserving the bags for Pfizer and now the institute in India that is supposed to produce a ton of the NVAX vaccines does not have access to them. However the CEO of the institute has [publicly pleaded for Biden to lift the embargo](https://twitter.com/megtirrell/status/1383129792292167680) and it seems like their may be [some action here soon](https://twitter.com/Cold_Peace_/status/1384537640322674689) especially given the dire COVID situation in India. I honestly have no fucking idea what will happen and this is simply what I have gathered in my investigative work across sources. Any clarity or insight here is super appreciated. I don't even know if these bags are reason NVAX was having manufacturing issues for the EU. Regardless, GSK is making some of the NVAX vaccine soon and they should have some stockpiled already at least for the UK and early approvers.

\-*NVAX US phase 3 trials must have had bad results that's why they haven't released the data yet.* I saved this one for last because it's the most unlikely one in my opinion. I'd be surprised to see repeatedly stellar results in US phase 1/2, UK phase 1/2/3interim/3final trials only to see something worse than JNJ's 66% efficacy in the US/Mexico phase 3 trial.

&#x200B;

**4) Catalysts and Questions for y'all**

OK this is where I summarize what I think will happen soon and also where I need input from y'all. NVAX has completely left us bagholders (oops, I mean investors) in the dark on some of these expected dates and it has been the source of [much strife in twitter comments](https://twitter.com/Novavax/status/1384489266483433472) against the leadership and PR team of NVAX. Not gonna lie they can learn to market and pump themselves more but I appreciate their hardwork on getting the science done well regardless.

**A) Filing for UK Approval**

\-From what I understand NVAX has already begun the rolling review by the UK MHRA and EU's EMA. They have provided the interim data for UK phase 3 at least and they hopefully have also submitted the finalized UK phase 3 data at this point but I do not know. 

\-Another thing they need to submit is a CMC package. This basically is evidence they provide these regulatory agencies that their manufacturing process is robust and can produce consistent vaccine batches. I have NO idea what the status is with this (did they finish it already?) and any insight is appreciated.

\-I can only imagine they'd make an announcement when they actually file in the UK but who knows. I also am curious to know how long after filing we can expect to see approval. My hope is that this whole process will be done and the vaccine will be approved by the [end of April](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-britain-vaccine/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-could-be-approved-by-uk-in-april-evening-standard-says-idUSKBN2BM1IF).

\-Guidance on this could literally drop any day this week or next week and I'm willing to bet we'll gap up on the news as always. As soon as it's approved by the UK then Canada, Australia, and New Zealand will likely follow suit.

**B) US Phase 3 results**

\-I'm super excited this is gonna be fucking awesome

\-US/Mexico Phase 3 trials started much later than the UK phase 3 trials. People were concerned for a long time that it would take a ton of time to get results. Even NVAX executives were saying that they were gonna swing for the fences and see if the US FDA would consider an EUA just with UK data instead of having to wait for US data. 

\-Turns out there were tons of willing participants and the trial got 25,000 people signed up in record time. Additionally, waves of covid caused collection of endpoints to happen much faster than expected. TODAY they started crossover trials. This basically means that people that had received the placebo get the read vaccine and people that got the real vaccine get the placebo (they are all still blinded). What is significant about this is that [THEY WOULDN'T DO THE CROSSOVER WITHOUT FIRST GETTING ENOUGH ENDPOINTS TO FILE FOR AN EUA](https://twitter.com/NayeemTheDream/status/1384265587770023942?s=1001).

\-We basically were all but explicitly told that US phase 3 is complete and the data/news can drop any day now. Put on your spacesuits.

**C) US FDA filing**

\-NVAX is [aiming for May](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/novavax-targets-may-approval-for-covid-19-vaccine-u-s). 

\-Again, I have no idea what the status is on the CMC package for the US filing and any insight is welcome.

\-There are some [interesting speculations on twitter](https://twitter.com/Biohazard3737/status/1384595862202896385) but I have a hard time making sense of them. Take it with a grain of salt as this guy/gal says him/herself.

**D) EU Deal**

\-The EU deal fell through last month but it seems like it could be getting revived soon. They are facing pressure after the AZN shitshow. 

\-This would be an awesome catalyst but don't hold your breath these EU chiefs are slow AF and seem to be generally fumbling oftentimes when it comes to securing doses for their populace

&#x200B;

**5) My positions and good ways to play this**

\-My positions are all in on $200c 5/21 options. Like literally my whole portfolio. I don't know that I would recommend this approach for most, the IV on these options is insanely high. I do, however, expect the IV of these options to expand following one of these catalysts. I know this is the opposite of what we typically think of with IV crush following binary events. However, I think the stock is exceptionally undervalued and I DO NOT think approval has been priced in. The majority of the gain will hopefully come from intrinsic value from the calls going deep ITM but I also hope to get an IV bump as people realize that this company has a rich future ahead of it and the call options gain demand. It has been an absolutely wild ride but I'm comfortable to say I now understand the true meaning of diamond hands.

\-Shares of course (or LEAPS) are godly if you have that sort of capital. Then you can just hang on for a long time. I will definitely switch to LEAPS after this immediate saga is over. I think once NVAX starts actually making a revenue it will absolutely blow earnings out of the park.

\-If you want to take advantage of high IV then of course theta gang strategies are nice. I caution against selling calls, this stock is ready to pop. Selling puts is a good strategy though you'll miss out on the extra tendies if they go parabolic. I severely caution against close expiration put credit spreads even though they are bullish because this stock CAN be squirrely and drop 10% in a day. If your spreads close OTM you can lose it all.

1618947682.0,281,Short Sellers Never Learn - They're Doubling Down on CLOV (DD),"At this point, seems a lot of people know about CLOV. Just so happens that the catalyst was a data error, but the opportunity is still quite strong even though the short interest isn't 144% of float. After all, it's now estimated at over 43%, making CLOV still one of the most shorted stocks in the entire market (if not THE most shorted stock).

Now, I actually bought into this at $7 several weeks ago. I first became aware of CLOV in the midst of the January hype, but I don't like buying high, so I stayed away. Came back a few weeks later and started watching for bullish signs as it dropped, saw that sweeeet solid bounce happening after tapping $6.50, and bought in around $7 myself.

https://preview.redd.it/5v5jbsepycu61.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=8804c928fbb1e9bcff4269a4808a906c2ff376bb

A few reasons for this initial bullishness from that point:

* I think the ""DOJ Investigation"" accusations are a bunch of hogwash and were causing a temporary and factually empty hammering of the stock.
* The average price target among analysts was at something like $13.50 at the time, with no analysts labeling it a sell. That is super promising for long-term holds.
* The market opportunity itself. CLOV is one of those ""will make it big or will die trying"" kind of stocks. I think they can make it in the space, but it's uncertain enough to give fuel to detractors, keeping the price down until their results start showing.
* The continued support shown around $7 weeks later just confirmed my bias, so I was watching closely to add to my position at the first sign of bullishness.

https://preview.redd.it/ebpjsdb00du61.png?width=198&format=png&auto=webp&s=f114a359f0333b9f693cdcffefe1aee139e748d1

Needless to say, seemed like a home run, a nice value opportunity for a long-term hold. Then, I became aware of the short interest.

Friday I saw my position exploding and had to look into why. Saw the 144% short interest report and increased my position by like 10x. This was no longer just a buy and hold for a high long-term gain, but could really explode up quickly! Turns out, the short interest wasn't quite accurate. But, ironically, this inaccurate short interest report actually did result from CLOV going from a top 10 short interest stock to quite possibly THE most shorted stock on the market in terms of float. Here's where it stands now according to Ortex. 

https://preview.redd.it/g7oobj1tqdu61.png?width=331&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa2960f93772aaee400260dc35a6fcd12df4da54

With a 90% util rate, just about every share even available to be lent for shorts is taken up at this point. Shorts have basically maxed out their position, making up about 43% of the technical float. 

However, a large portion of the float is not actually ""available"". Given the information available on their most recent 10-K, it appears that roughly 87 million shares are owned by insiders/controlling investors. This leaves less than 60 million shares actually available for the ""real"" available float. This is likely why the util rate is at 90% despite less than half of the shares being on loan. We're at an ""effective"" short interest of roughly 75% and rising.

Y'all, I liked this stock before this whole thing, but now I love it. This is a pretty unique opportunity to squeeze some shorts. I don't want to say it's the ""next GME"", because obviously GME actually was shorted all the way past 100% of float and was a turnaround story itself. GME also took a super long time to actually take off and make that squeeze happen. I was in GME in Feb and March of 2020 and actually had sadly taken out my money when the stock hit like $24 in Dec (I never imagined it might go into the $40s, much less $400+).

I don't see this as a ""turnaround story"" so much as a stock that has been massively underestimated by the market due to some hammering of Chamath and general SPAC distaste. For me, this is a value play that's been enhanced by the potential for a pretty massive short squeeze.

Full disclosure, I currently hold:

* 300 shares
* One 21 May 7.5 C
* One 18 Jun 7 C
* One 20 Aug 12.5 C

I'm also waiting on a deposit to clear, with which I plan to purchase a LEAP. I may roll my May call into something with a later expiry as well given how hard it can be to time these things.

P.S. To top it all off, I'm a giant fan of the Wyckoff Method. The daily chart looks like a great Wyckoff setup right now, with today's pullback to the neckline area providing a promising potential LPS."

1618945345.0,190,Battleground ? It’s a mothaf’in WAR. MVIS ✋💎💎💎💎💎🤚,
1618944594.0,20,Credit Suisse (CS) Investors Are Overreacting to Greensill and Archegos,"Disclaimer: If you’re here for rocket emojis and short squeezes, move along. I’m not going to be offering any certainty here, nor am I going to tell you exactly how to play CS. That said, if you’re going to stick around, I hope you enjoy!

To understand what’s going on with Credit Suisse right now, we have to first discuss two major events that happened in the financial world since the last quarterly report: The collapse of Greensill and Archegos.

Greensill Capital was a supply chain financial services company that made money in three ways:

* Reverse factoring^[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_finance)
* Factoring^[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factoring_\(finance\))
* Future accounts receivables finance^[3](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountsreceivablefinancing.asp)

Future accounts receivables finance tends to be especially risky since the lender is essentially issuing a loan to the lendee against collateral that the lendee has been promised from another party but has not yet received. However, Greensill may have actually taken this one step further and issued loans with collateral being money the lendee was predicted to be promised but had not yet actually been promised.

In July of 2020, one of Greensill’s insurers, Tokio Marine, discovered that a Tokio Marine employee had broken internal risk management limits in some way while insuring Greensill Capital (I’m guessing it’s directly related to the aggressive future accounts receivables financing practices, but I don’t have any evidence or sources to back this up). In response, Tokio Marine ceased insuring Greensill, leaving $4.8 billion of working capital uninsured. Greensill attempted to get an extension of coverage but failed and was forced to look for a new insurer. The problem was that no one wanted to insure them. On March 1st, 2021, after eight months of having billions of uninsured working capital and even more default insurance that expired over that previous weekend, Credit Suisse began freezing supply-chain investment funds in Greensill. That very same day, Greensill began filing for insolvency, and insolvency protection was granted on the 8th of March. I’ll skip the boring stuff, but Credit Suisse’s loss is estimated to be roughly $3 billion. I don’t know exactly how much of that is going to hit CS directly vs. their clients, but needless to say, it won’t be pretty either way.

Now let’s talk about Archegos.

Archegos was a family office that imploded in March of 2021. In order to understand what happened, you need to first understand what a Total Return Swap is.^[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_return_swap) Essentially (and this is simplified), a TRS allows you to ask the bank to hold a stock for you and pay you any appreciation or dividends, and you pay them a fixed (or sometimes variable) rate in return. This allows you to benefit from a share of a stock as if you held it yourself, but without having to actually own it. Because you don’t own the stock yourself with a TRS, Archegos was able to get a metric fuckton of loans without reporting their ViacomCBS (VIAC) and Discovery (DISCA) positions, thereby deceiving the loaners as to just how exposed and heavily leveraged they were on highly volatile positions.^[5](https://youtu.be/58Sx26Gt6H8) They did this for several major banks, namely Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, and Nomura Holdings. Archegos was margin-called due to a large, synchronized ~27% drop in both VIAC and DISCA. Several large banks began liquidating Archegos’s TRS positions at roughly the same time in response (remember, the banks held these stocks, not Archegos themselves). This resulted in an additional 27% drop. Certain banks were able to get out faster than others, but CS and Nomura were especially slow to act.

So, what was the result of all of this? All-in-all, Archegos is expected to cost Credit Suisse somewhere in the ballpark of $4.7 billion.^[6](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/trading-update-202104.html) That figure is not expected to increase meaningfully as new information comes out.^[7](https://www.wsj.com/articles/regulators-question-credit-suisse-over-recent-archegos-related-stock-sales-11618934842) This $4.7 billion is in addition to the $3 billion loss from Greensill, bringing the final loss for Credit Suisse to somewhere in the ballpark of $7.7 billion in a single quarter. This is 95% of CS's total operating income (profit) for the past three years.

So, with all of these big, scary numbers, why am I still bullish?

Simply put, their balance sheet doesn’t justify the hit Credit Suisse’s stock took. CS had $805.8 billion in assets, $139.1 billion (17.3%) of that in cash alone as of December 31st, 2020.^[8](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CS/balance-sheet?p=CS) A $7.7 billion loss is only 0.95% of assets and 5.5% of cash – they could eat this loss almost 18 times and wouldn’t have to liquidate a single non-cash asset. The loss as compared to equity ($65.3 billion) is significantly bigger, constituting an 11.7% hit after subtracting liabilities. However, this, in my opinion, does not justify the ~30% hit the stock has taken.^[9](https://i.imgur.com/QZmciLp.png) To build on this, their price to book ratio was 0.56 as of five days ago^[10](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CS/key-statistics?p=CS), which also indicates CS is a strong value investment, Book value is sitting at $17.74 but the current price is only $10.30, meaning there is at least 72% upside, although that is probably unrealistic in the short and medium terms.

As if this wasn’t enough, Credit Suisse has been in business since 1856, and it will take a lot more than a $7.7 billion loss to bring a financial giant like this to its knees. In fact, they are even named as one of the Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFI),^[11](https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_131111.pdf) They are, quite literally (and by definition), too big to fail. The responsible executives have also been removed^[12](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/changes-in-the-exb-credit-suisse-ch-202104.html) which shows they are going to be taking their risk management far more seriously in the future. Loss prevention on this scale will probably not happen again for some time because this loss is going to be at the forefront of their minds for a while.

How can this play go wrong then? Well, in the long-term, I’m fairly confident I’m right and that the market is overreacting to Greensill and Archegos. It did wipe about three years of profit from the balance sheet, but financially, the company is in a pretty solid place regardless. The more important variable is how it affected client trust, which will be difficult to gauge. I think there are fundamentally too many positive forces holding CS up to allow it to fall, but the current price reflects an overly bearish scenario. People are comparing Archegos to Longterm Capital Management when that is simply not the case. LTCM ended up leveraging themselves to the tune of $1.25 trillion while Archegos lost somewhere in the ballpark of $10-$20 billion with VIAC and DISCA. That said, CS certainly has the opportunity to go south in the short term. CS reports Q1 results on April 22nd, two days from now^[13](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/events/calendar.html) and, especially considering the market’s behavior over the past several days, I think it’s possible that investors will panic after listening to the earnings call. They may overestimate the damage, sell in fear, and cause the stock to drop even further. The reality is that this bank is not going anywhere. CS is going to be around in 5-10 years no matter what, yet the current pricing feels like investors expect doomsday on April 22nd. The second scenario is that the earnings call inspires confidence, although I personally this is less likely due to the fact that this did wipe out three years of profit. In this scenario, the best-case scenario I can realistically see happening is CS trading sideways, since some people are going to sell anyway. If it does dip, I’m hoping to pick up as many of those shares as possible.

I want to be clear that I still very much have questions about how the fine details are going to work when it comes to the loss’s interaction with Credit Suisse’s balance sheet. I am not quite sure what amount of the damage is going to hit CS’s clients vs. falling directly on Credit Suisse. The answer to that question is very relevant, yet I have not been able to find a clear answer. I also do not know for sure what the post-earnings reaction will be. My guess is just that: a guess. Also, if I’m missing or misanalyzing this, please do call me out as I genuinely want this to be the highest quality DD possible. Thanks for reading to the end!

Edit: I'm aware GS and MS destroyed CS here - hell, I spent the past week reading about it. I believe in the American banks for more, I just think CS stock is pricing in a hellfire scenario."

I've been playing very close attention to the George Floyd trial, and anyone with a brain can tell that this Chauvin guy is probably going to get off. Regardless of how you feel about that, there is an opportunity to make massive amounts of money.

Everyone here except maybe the 7+ million members who joined since June 2020 remembers the [massive protests that took place](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/06/us/us-george-floyd-protests-saturday/index.html) when that event first went down. These protests largely started out peaceful, but many escalated into violence targeting local businesses. One of the most targeted businesses during these events was CVS (ticker $CVS). [CVS got his so hard they were forced to close some locations!!!](https://www.businessinsider.com/cvs-closes-some-stores-looting-protests-2020-6) Let's look at what happened to CVS stock over the same period of time:

&#x200B;

[See that Drop???](https://preview.redd.it/jr83oz706du61.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&s=a464465a4ed3279cac2c39dfd8063576aa82dcd6)

You guys see that drop??? CVS dropped 10% in a couple of weeks right when all this was going on! So what does this have to do with the trial??? By my estimations, the outcry from an acquittal will be roughly 10 times larger than what happened in June 2020. Doing some napkin math here, 10 times of 10% is 100%!!! Meaning if Chauvin is acquitted, CVS will be going all the way down to $0/share!!! The market is clearly not pricing this in, as CVS is currently trading at about $76/share, $76 more than it is actually worth.

With a verdict expected by the end of May, there is still time to get in on this once in a lifetime trade!!! I only wish I had enough capital to make (almost) unlimited gains on this play.

* Americans in general more prone to spend money on frivolities given low interest rates and stimmy checks
* Huge demand of goods from China almost collapsed the supply chain. $WISH ships directly from China
* Rumor has it that Amazon offered 10B for WISH back in 2015 and CEO wouldn't sell (mkt cap is around 7B currently).
* CEO is an ex-Google employee
* Most downloaded play store app of 2018
* centralized hub for buying random/wacky shit
* Gamification of the buying experience makes users spend more on the platform
* The absolute apes at Loop capital have a $40 price target. The more trustworthy people over at evercore initiated recently with a price target of $22
* Exposure to international markets, not just the US
* You'd literally be buying @ an all time low valuation

GOEV has a history of failure to deliver; combine this with high call option volume, and you have a lot of tinder. If the share price reverses (and depending on how quickly) this could be a prime squeeze candidate.

Canoo ($GOEV) has been beaten into oblivion over the past 2 weeks, and now trades at a steep discount to the SPAC vehicle that acquired it. This came after a disappointing earnings call and a major shakeup in the business model as well as leadership. Obviously there is a lot of FUD in the stock, and shorts have taken advantage of this sentiment to drive down the price. 


**No Shares Available to Borrow:** In fact, the amount of shorting over the past 2 weeks has now resulted in 0 shares available to borrow (according to fintel).

https://imgur.com/a/YLQSnS9

**High Recent Short Volume:** As you can see there have been ~10M shares sold short over the past 2 weeks, and GOEV already had a 15% short interest before this. Add this all up you could have anywhere from 50-60% of the float currently sold short.


**Failure to deliver:** GOEV also has a history of high failure to deliver whenever the price spikes. There were over 1.1M shares that failed to be delivered on 03/22. This indicates that shorts are overextending themselves.


**Gamma Squeeze Potential:** There is also extremely high call volume for the $10 and $15 strike, so if it starts to approach those price levels there will be increased buying pressure due to gamma hedging. 

Main takeaway: If the stock starts to reverse course before the shorts cover this could jump very fast to $10-15 again. Because of this, I will be opening a small long position.

1618932023.0,85,Lumber Industry DD,"First DD so give me your patience.

Housing is fucking nuts in the past year as people move out of the cities and into suburbs across America and the world. This has led to great plays like UWMC or RKT, which have had their time and I would still argue are undervalued but that's not the point right now. 

As the housing demand went so high, each industry involved in housing shot up; mortgages are the most recent example, with RKT doubling in a week and UWMC seeing a 40% week earlier this march. Homebuilders like [TOL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TOL/) and [LEN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LEN/) have also seen enormous runups. These all make sense because houses are expensive and the volume moving on the market is obscene. The next logical step is not far from what the vitards pulled off with the steel plays like $MT: directing your attention at the most base material for all this shit.

**Stocks in question**

The stocks in mind are UFP Industries ($UFPI), a Michigan based wood and wood alternative producer, and Louisiana Pacific (LPX), a Tennessee based lumber product producer. I picked these two because they've both got solid results over the past year, are substantial companies, and have earnings coming as soon as tomorrow after close for UFPI. Their products go into American houses at every step, from the main beams to the siding, [and lumber has only gotten more expensive in the past year.](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/lumber)

Lumber futures also signal that this will continue for a while: 

>Even the May 2022 contract, a full year out the curve from the current spot month, is priced at “only” a 25 percent discount. None of this is good news for builders or other professional buyers of nearly all grades of lumber, because they’ve got to have lumber to build, and the building season is hitting full stride as the calendar advances. These folks are paying up because they have no alternative, and there is no indication this trend will end anytime soon. The pros who use lumber will continue to buy what they need, if they can get it, even at elevated price levels.

^https://www.forbes.com/sites/salgilbertie/2021/04/17/lumber-prices-rocket-higher-as-demand-overwhelms-supply/?sh=2a2fe3cf21f9

The futures price of lumber regardless, there is a lumber shortage and those who stand to gain the most are those who produce it. Homebuilders too may suffer

> American Homes 4 Rent, which built more than 1,600 rentals last year and plans to construct another 2,000 houses this year, said its lumber bill is between $20,000 and $25,000 per house, up from about $10,000.

^https://www.wsj.com/articles/commodities-boom-hits-home-11615973404

Another nice thing is that LPX and UFPI have a p/e ratio of ~15 and ~20 respectively, so you're not buying into some overpriced trash shit even in this market of nutty valuations.

**Short Interest**

Don't ask me about the fucking short interest you fucking ape

**Positions to capitalize**

UFPI posts its Q1 2021 earnings tomorrow. Whereas lumber futures traded from 550-660 for most of Q4 '20, they rocketed up at the end of december and have traded between 668 at a low to nearly 1000 by the end of the quarter. For this reason, I believe that a strong earnings beat is very likely for UFPI, and calls would be great but the fact that they are only available for May 21 kind of is a a ball buster. I'm buying calls only but that's because I am poor

For LPX, they have earnings in May, but its not unreasonable to treat them the same. It is best to save the trouble of theta decay and wait to buy calls, but if UFPI smashes earnings then LPX may go up in expectations of a similar earnings beat as they have significant crossover in their products. 

**personal positions**

1 UFPI share, 1 UFPI 5/21 $80C, 1 LPX 5/21 $70C

With the Cramer video I posted he said he ‘liked the stock long-term’.  In Cramer-speak I knew, I knew I could get killed in the short-term – I got killed.  However he has drilled into me over the years: “**Diversification is the only free lunch in the stock market”**.  That has saved me, I’m not dead meat in retirement – just a bit annoyed.  And I’m more annoyed at plug CEO Andy Marsh.  I wish he would hit the airwaves and reassure us buckaroos out here the accounting error(s) are no big deal – over and over again would be nice.

I thought it might be helpful for some people to see what I'm doing. I had quite a few comments on both my $ASO and my $CLOV posts. $MVIS is a new one for me today, and I will be buying some calls at market open.   


Two weeks ago I had gotten some ASO stock + calls. I sold my calls for a nice profit before expiration and got into CLOV on Friday. I had 3,000 shares of CLOV + these options below.   


As you can see in my screenshot I've sold off some of my CLOV shares....why? Well, I wanted to free up some cash for $MVIS. One thing I know is that there is a rabid hate for Jim Cramer in this subreddit.....and the $MVIS post u/s2upid with the Cramer video + his youtube video about microvision and then also the post by  u/OG_ClapCheekz69  about his micropenis (which made me LOL) give me some hope $MVIS has some real movement today. There is some good DD within the posts / comments around Microvision.   


Last week $ASO didn't move much...but it is this week. I'm sort of thinking that this week $CLOV might do the same. Often times when ""short squeeze"" gets mentioned with a stock...if it's not up 100%+ in a day or two...it's like people think it's not moving fast enough and get bored. Sure...$CLOV was up 20% friday, and what 8% yesterday? I'm keeping my calls in $CLOV because I think the strikes I bought are solid going into May 21.

&#x200B;

Outside of this, I saw a lot of people complaining about having red accounts yesterday, I was so deep into $CLOV I didn't notice it. As the 10 year yield rises, I'll be buying some calls on the VIX and I might even buy some puts on Apple today...because I think it's risen pretty quick, and the event today...it's ipads, airtags and maybe airpods, it's not that exciting...if the 10 year keeps going $AAPL will probably get some selling by institutions / money managers bc they're risk appetite is non existent. Maybe I'll write another DD on $AAPL before they report earnings / after the event if people are interested. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, updating on my positions bc often times when you write a DD...people get excited / hyped about something and then feel left in the dark not knowing what the person who wrote it is thinking. I'm still bullish on $CLOV $ASO and $MVIS.

https://en.letsgodigital.org/smartphones/blackberry-5g-smartphone-2021/
 
As you can see there is plenty of interesting stuff going on…
 
There are plenty of DDs posted on WSB for BlackBerry already and I would only tell the same news again so here is the link for the best one if you want to know more about their products.
Thanks to u/_MoveSwiftly for that great post.

So what has changed since the DD I posted above?
 
BlackBerry released their earnings, which led to a big dip, that keeps dipping. Reasons for the dip? Honestly I don’t get it. There are literally only positive news for the future. But the boomers don’t care, they are probably still salty their favourite phone company from the good old days is gone and they don’t like the new touch tech.
 
Now the good… And there is plenty good.

1618896576.0,150,My fellow PLTR apes should know the risks,"I love PLTR stock, I bought at DPO and sold half at 40 (where the valuation was just getting too dumb for a stock with 30-40% growth - I am planning to buy again when it declines more). 

The company is great and I can tell you first hand that they only hire the brightest to work there. 

But I want to teach you apes (the ones who want to hold this for 4-5 years) about valuation. Let’s do a an experiment, I assume that PLTR blows their prediction of 30% growth in the next 4 years and grows by 40% (that will be very hard to accomplish so this is a very bullish 33% average beat). 

We have a revenue of 1.1 billion for 2020, have that grow for 4 years by 40% (1.1*1.40^4 =4.2). That results into a revenue of 4.2 billion. When I use a PS multiple I assume they improve their margins and are not considered a consulting business- that would be disastrous for the stock - therefore, I am still very bullish. Splunk - which is a worse competitor has had an average 5 year PS of 10. If we apply a price to sales of 10 we are trading today at a 2024 PS ratio of 10! If we take an extra bullish view (we can apply a PS of 15 - which quite curiously appears in a lot of VC late stage funding valuations); with a 15 PS we have a 63 billion valuation which implies a 50% growth from here in 4 years. Which is insane especially since I took into consideration extra growth.

I know most of you 🦍 like to gamble but if you plan to hold this for 10 years this is a great pick, but don’t be surprised if in 4 years you’re up only 50%. Moreover, for those of you who like to gamble please learn to find run ups to catalysts and improve your chances of succeeding (if you want me to delve deeper into that leave a comment - there are surprising methods to the madness). ✌️"

I'm still long CCL, NCLH, JETS, and EXPE but not much movement since February. 2 names have higher beta and look much better from a technical perspective, with not as much headline coverage.

1. CWH (Camping World Wide) - the pandemic essentially brought forward purchases from anyone who was planning on RVing/camping over the next few years all to 2020 and 2021. Though there are some fintwit dudes who think the RV trend saw its peak in 2020 - I highly doubt folks who spent 50-100k on an RV are going to let their fancy Airstream pocket buses idle just to make it to happy hour at Texas Roadhouse when everything reopens. IMO, the US might be ahead in vaccinations, but the outdoor camping, hiking, and exploring crowd have kicked off a new multi-year trend. Ask yourself, how many of you/your friends have posted pics of their latest hike on IG featuring their newly adopted covid puppy? Almost forgot about the company itself: CWH sells RVs, but most of the margin is derived from services and memberships. They are also partnered to develop an EV RV. The CEO is Marcus Lemonis, who is the Prophet (comes on after Shark Tank). From a technical perspective, CWH is about to break its ATH made back in 2017. Who knows what happens after $43. Probably $44, but then what?
2. ELY (Callaway Golf) - the play is pretty simple, golfing is outdoors and is at least upper middle if not upper class. These guys (some of you) spend thousands on clubs, and thousands on memberships and fees - golf was essentially unaffected by the pandemic and if anything probably got a much needed bump in participation. If the pandemic continues to rage on, this semi-outdoor activity will be booked out. If the pandemic is magically over by summer, this semi-outdoor activity is booked out anyways. To top this off, Callaway just pulled off the most synergistic move since Exxon and Mobil merged, and recently completed the purchase of TopGolf. What's wonderful about this is activity is it revolves mostly around drinking and food and drinking. And they are busy 100% of 70% of the time. [Check out this DD from another poster a few weeks ago on how booked out Topgolf really is.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdsx3i/ely_dd_i_tried_making_an_online_reservation_at_60/) It also draws golfers and non-golfers alike, so essentially the TAM is the whole world. While golfing as a sport is probably not what it was 20 years ago, this ain't about sports. This is hanging out and getting trashed while trying to one up your friends wood game. Edit: I figured this is self explanatory, but yes I forgot to mention some folks who try Top Golf might end up purchasing Callaway clubs and actually golfing on a course, but this is marginal IMO. Not everyone who goes bowling ends up with a bowling ball. Amirite? Guys? Anywhoo, me like. 

As always, do your own DD. I like the stonks. Not financial researcher advisor professor. Just dude."

**Updated snapshot of consolidated option position** (stock in separate account). Open calls, heavily weighted towards safer strikes because I'm a pansy. Position is understated both in total and net return by about $20k because Ally is hot garbage.

[Open: May 21 $125, $130, $135. Aug 20 $120, $125, $130, $140, $145, $150, $160 ](https://preview.redd.it/xcprmy2ub7u61.png?width=1631&format=png&auto=webp&s=975fbcfbc92569cdc660d471ad5f391ce39a236d)

**TL;DR yet again** \- Quest performed over 10.4 million COVID tests during Q1 and base case testing has rebounded. They are still executing over $900 million in share repurchases over the next 3 months, which equates to a buyback of roughly 5% of their float. Then they have another $ BILLION of repurchases authorized for the back half of 2021 as well. Additionally, the technicals are some of the most bullish I've ever seen. And yet, the company still trades well behind their top competitor, Labcorp $LH. **I'll say it until I'm blue in the face from wearing these 6 masks, $DGX remains the safest trade in this market.**

**$DGX vs $LH** \- Look, I think I've beaten this comparison to death over the previous DDs, so I'll just add this quick table reflecting DGX share price as a % of LH. Note that prices are somewhat smoothed within each month.

https://preview.redd.it/rnve5wp4h7u61.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb8af65266c0df12e9022e4ba9b2c93cb04e4a6b

That's a pretty damn consistent trend isn't it? And don't worry, I know you aren't here to do math. If $DGX was trading at a conservative 60% of LH, it would be $156. Right now. Now, people can argue the LH Covance acquisition makes their growth prospects better than Quest. Maybe. But it certainly shouldn't drive this large of a variance.

**Charting / Technicals** \- Virtually all technicals are neutral or **VERY bullish** at this point. I also encourage those who like charting to checkout the 1-2 year trend. Then for more fun, take a look at the intraday trading over the last 60ish days. Look, I think charting is worthless 95% of the time as are technicals without a lot of context, but there are some obvious patterns in trading over the last couple months specifically. To me, it's clear institutions have been deliberately chasing out retail and consistently repurchasing at a lower price. On-balance Volume is soaring, which when combined with other metrics, is a great indicator of large ""smart money"" bets. This happens all the time. It's why stocks like Apple unexpectedly flatline for substantial periods of time, then make a huge move upward on ""info"" or ""results"" that you thought were easily foreseeable long ago.

**Institutions** and other big boys (or, conversely, dbag hedgefunds) - **13F filings** in Q1 and Q2 (so far) were absurdly bullish on $DGX, buying the stock at nearly a $4 to $1 rate. This is a much higher rate than usual for $DGX and VASTLY higher than the ratio of $$$ intuitions are putting into $LH.

**Shorts/shorting because this is WSB after all -** The amount of shares short is surprisingly interesting right now. Sure, an increase in shares short to nearly 4m doesn't seem like a lot on a float of 132m at face value. But $DGX has 90% institutional ownership, the majority of which isn't being moved (Vanguard is largest owner and Quest has a solid dividend). So the public/retail is really playing with 16m shares or so. Then factor in $DGX is repurchasing around 14 million shares this year, depending on buyback price. **Now that 4 million shares short becomes VERY material.**

**$DGX Q1 Performance -** I still expect a big beat, projecting over $4 EPS on a lower than expected drop off in COVID testing, substantial increases in base testing (core business), increasing acquisition revenue, and additional COVID research projects. Quest continues to flat out tell you they are still crushing COVID testing. Sure, it's down slightly from Q4, but remains much higher than 2020 Q2 and Q3. Adjusted run rate for April remains high as well. And now they will have base testing back again.

Now what is even more interesting is that not all of the free float shares are actually ""free"" because Chamath and his buddy Ian own significant number of shares which are locked under lock-up agreement.

This leaves us with approx. **60 million shares** up for trading assuming Vanguard wants to flip their shares (*unlikely but let's assume*).

Dividing today's volume of **230 million** with **60 million** gives us **3.83**. This means that **every available CLOV share exchanged hands today almost 4 times**!  


Huge volume + huge exchange of shares + relatively flat price = short ladder attacks  


Here is the definition:  
*To execute a short ladder attack, two bearish hedge funds trade shares of stock back and forth between each other at lower and lower prices in order to create the illusion that the price is dropping and scare owners into panic selling.*

My theory is that whoever is shorting CLOV is trying to suppress the price until the hype dies down and hopefully gives them an easier exit from their short positions.

Since an emergency paid article on Bloomberg bashing Chamath on a Saturday at 9:00 a.m. did not work as expected considering CLOV went up today on a market red day, they have to think of something to prevent things from getting out of control.  


[Bloomberg is reminding us about SEC investigation, even though Clover has been awarded to operate in new states few weeks ago.](https://preview.redd.it/7dine2lwa7u61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7296f1fed7eff640158220f1cb1bff8b95e57a02)

1618868879.0,690,A 14 year-old's Take on Algorithmic Stock Trading - TradeAlgo,"Hey r/wallstreetbets, I've been working on a stock trading algorithm these past couple months. My interest in trading began this January and since I'm lazy as shit and I know how to code, I decided to code myself something that would trade for me.

For this project, I used Python and the TD Ameritrade API. I will begin by saying that the TD Ameritrade API is absolute garbage and you should use something else if you want to try something like this.

The code for TradeAlgo can be found here: [https://github.com/4pz/TradeAlgo](https://github.com/4pz/TradeAlgo)

TradeAlgo uses web scraping to pull a list of stocks which are predicted to rise already. After the list is scraped, each symbol is then checked to validate if they match the parameters set in the code. (These parameters are created by me after extensive research on how to predict a rising stock)

After this, the total balance of your TD Ameritrade account is pulled using the TD Ameritrade API and your total balance is split among the stocks which matched the set parameters. You can change how much money from your account is allocated to be used with the algorithm by changing the balance variable to the desired amount.

Finally, the buy function is called to execute all orders with a trailing stop loss to ensure minimal losses.

I've also included a way to only see a list of recommended stocks without actually buying them so if you want to make your own educated decisions after seeing what TradeAlgo advises, you can do that.

**Make sure to check out the repositories ReadMe for detailed setup and usage instructions!**

You should check out [my first post on Coinbase + trading volume](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mr1za6/coin_150b_570share_price_target/). Its shorter, does back of the envelope math, and offers a primer for this denser analysis. It introduces the claim that trading volume has entered new 'phases' of elevated activity \*despite entering and exiting bull cycles\*

In this follow-up post, I perform quantitative analysis on trading volume to potentially forecast profit. With that being said, most of these numbers are purely for reference as the analysis does not accurately capture all of Coinbase's revenue streams. Moreover, estimates around volume contractions make some firm assumptions that can blow up in my face.

&#x200B;

edit: ""volume"" is in reference to Coinbase's exchange (trading pairs that cannot be named). Volume does *not* refer to the actual volume of $COIN shares

# TLDR:

* I target a conservative 50 forward PE Ratio, given Paypal's 59.52 forward PE Ratio and Square's 204 forward PE Ratio
* If coinbase trading volume contracts half as strong as typical volume-contractions, **$556/share is 50x PE**
* If coinbase trading volume continues for the remainder of 2021, $800/share is 50x PE
* If coinbase trading volume contracts -36% (unlikely given institutional presence) $313/share is 50x PE

* I will post updates and re-runs at the end of each quarter to see if my forecasts are worthwhile

# Methods:

* exchanges: Coinbase Pro, Kraken, Gemini, Binance, Binance US
   * I picked the exchanges that had substantial volume and were open to US customers. I included Binance as a way to get a temperature on the global trading activity.
* pairs:  (see the Colab notebook for the list, the names wont make it past automod)
   * I picked the largest trading pairs (by USD volume) on Coinbase Pro. While the smaller pairs do not influence the trade volume substantially, it provides a bit of a gauge when new trading pairs become available on Coinbase.
* **>> PHASES <<**: A new volume-phase is entered when the next 30-day average daily volume (ADV) exceeds the previous 30-day average daily volume by 120%. A phase contracts when the next 30-day ADV falls -45% compared to the previous 30-day ADV
   * these numbers are arbitrary and were chosen as they seem to model the volume-phases reasonably well without picking up the noise
* **Limitations**:
   * Coinbase Pro as a proxy for Coinbase, the main app's trading volume could also be substantial
   * Trading pairs are a curated list and do not capture volume in totality
   * Coinbase's fee changes remain unchanged [Source](https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1382279472599162880)

# 'Global' USD Daily Trading Volume + Phases

https://preview.redd.it/nm7p04lor5u61.png?width=1604&format=png&auto=webp&s=28b1136683aa37e592f7641b378af8cc4dbb89f1

* 'Global' as in across all exchanges and all pairs, mentioned above
* The current Jan 2021 breakout observes an explosive volume phase, and is the source behind Coinbase's eye-popping Q1 $1.8B revenue and $800M profit
* July 2019 will provide some guidance on the January 2021 phase. At the time, a record-high volume phase is followed by a contraction that is sustained and higher than the prior long-term volume phase (\~Janurary 2019).
* It would be misleading to not comment on January 2018's phase contraction. The favorable explanation is July 2018 volume phase is \~4 times larger than Apr 2017 phase. More so, the January 2018 cycle had 'altcoins' flaring to record high valuations, and are not entirely captured in the trading pairs provided. Additionally, the 2018 cycle likely did not have substantial institutional support that we are witnessing today

# Coinbase Pro vs. Gemini

https://preview.redd.it/1d1gvbmqr5u61.png?width=1604&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3eb44ff085323d26a7b460a7955387b5718f47c

* This was a byproduct discovery, but Gemini's most recent trade volume seems to match the 2018 cycle. This to me implies that Gemini's user base has not grown aggressively as Coinbase's or its that institutional investors/traders have really warmed up to Coinbase. Bullish.

# Volume Phase Breakout + Contraction

How much does average daily  volume change between phases?

|Exchange|Average Phase Change|Average Phase Breakout|Average Phase Contraction|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Global|68.17%|157.4%|\-29.17%|
|Coinbase|54.16%|121.81%|\-36.04%|
|Binance|81.53%|152.4%|\-12.95%|
|Kraken|54.53%|129.3%|\-35.19%|
|Binance US|104.01%|148.87%|\-52.97%|
|Gemini|67.96%|178.26%|\-32.31%|

* Average Phase Change: the average % change between phases (regardless of up or down)
* Average Phase Breakout: the average % change when a new phase is *higher* than the previous
* Average Phase Contraction: the average % change when a new phase is *lower* than the previous

# Seasonality

https://preview.redd.it/0jpardbtr5u61.png?width=1589&format=png&auto=webp&s=51d24e7bfcde67827420ac4f666f162e64eafc6e

* To confirm that Q1 (and Q2 estimates) can be used for Q3 and Q4, I perform a simple seasonality check. For each month since 2017: what is the average daily volume
* The Colab notebook contains the sum of USD trading volume by month
* There's no immediate explanation for why different parts of the year would have increased trading activity, therefore I assume that trading volume does not exhibit seasonality.

# Forecasts and Price Targets

* Assumes that operational costs are $1 billion (Q1 2021 $1.8 Billion, 800 Million Profit)
* Volume contraction in Q2 is carried out for the remainder of the year (except for Neutral-Bear case)

**Using Coinbase Historical Volume Contraction**

|Case|Volume Contraction|2021 Profit Forecast|Share Price, if 50x PE|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Bull|0%|$3.2 billion|$800.00|
|Neutral|\-18.02%|$2.23 billion|$556.74|
|Bear|\-36.04%|$1.25 billion|$313.49|

**Using Global Historical Volume Contraction**

|Case|Volume Contraction|2021 Profit Forecast|Share Price, if 50x PE|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Bull|0%|$3.2 billion|$800.00|
|Neutral|\-14.585%|$2.4 billion|$603.11|
|**Neutral-Bear**|**-14.585% each Quarter**|**$1.77  billion**|**$443.09**|
|Bear|\-29.17%|$1.62 billion|$406.23|

* Bull Case: the volume does not contract at all for the remainder of 2021
* Neutral Case: the volume contracts half as strong as typical contractions, and holds for the remainder of 2021
* **Neutral-Bear Case: the volume contracts -14.5% quarter over quarter (Q2's volume is -14.5% over Q1, and Q3's volume is -14.5% over Q2, etc.)**
* Bear Case: the volume contracts as much as typical contractions

*Rough* formula:

`share price = ((1.8 + (1.8 * Q2-contraction) + (1.8 * Q3-contraction) + (1.8 * Q4-contraction) - 4) / 0.2 * 50)`

* `1.8` $1.8 Billion revenue Q1
* `contraction` 0.8 = -20% volume contraction
* `4` subtract operational costs. Q1: $800 million profit off of $1.8 billion revenue, therefore \~$1 billion operational costs each quarter
* `0.2` 200 million outstanding shares
* `50` 50x PE ratio target

# Closing Thoughts (Apr 2021)

The USD volume is exceptionally noisy and fluctuates aggressively. Tweaking the parameters can and will show an entirely different forecast. No one will know how, when, and where this volume-phase will end up; therefore approximating Coinbase's revenue via exchange volume has substantial risk.

But with increased institutional adoption, balance sheet reporting, and favorable discourse around cryptocurrencies, my own impressions believe that we haven't seen the volume-phase 'top' and I believe the subsequent contraction won't be extreme as previously observed. When comparing Coinbase against its competitors, its doing well to continue its growth. Additionally, this analysis entirely ignores other coins, trading pairs, and the additional revenue streams expected by Coinbase. Despite the possibility of a strong volume-phase contraction, I believe this analysis provides a somewhat incomplete picture and does not factor in other bullish cases for Coinbase.

In the words of Thanos, if we take each case as equally-probable, ""perfectly-balanced, as all things should be"", the expected value per share (average of each case) is between $556.74 - $603.11 (neutral case). I believe taking on risk head-first is a ""small price to pay for salvation""

1618860515.0,0,Potentially overshorted stock with a catalyst? Root Insurance - $ROOT,"Been trying to find value stocks but it’s not easy in a bull market so I’d thought I’d look at heavily shorted stocks. Haven’t seen much discussion about this company and thought I’d share. 

Root Insurance is a fintech company that had an IPO at the end of October. Their aim is to reinvent how auto insurance is done. You download the app and let it monitor your driving behavior for a few weeks. After the trial test driving period is done they give you a quote. Services are in 30 states. They are also getting into the home insurance market.

They seem to have a ton of class action lawsuits against them, the typical “contact us if you lost money on your investment” that every company has to deal with. They debuted at $27 and have gone down since and are at $10.30 as of writing this.  

Looking at insider transactions I noticed someone named Meyer Malka bought one million shares at $27 near IPO. Later in December he bought the dip and increased his position by 753,976 shares at $16.55 each. 

Did a web search for him and found this Walmart press release. 

https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/01/11/walmart-announces-creation-of-new-fintech-startup

Tl;dr - Walmart partners with fintech investment firm Ribbit Capital (which Meyer Malka is on the board of) to offer “next generation digital financial products""

Walmart tried to sell car insurance back in 2014 (https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2014/04/30/walmart-works-with-autoinsurance-com-to-bring-customers-first-of-its-kind-comparison-service) but that deal never panned out it seems. 

ROOT is currently 41% sold short. I want to compare it to LMND which is also an insurance company that had IPO recently but I haven’t been following that company at all so I won’t say anymore on the subject.

The stock saw an insane increase of activity from insider trading, hedge funds, and general volume in the last quarter. 

While we don't like hedge funds, it's odd to see this volume of buy without much selling - especially as it's dipping. 

  
Q: **Why is this a post lockdown player?**

A: The tool was sold to lodes of companies trying to better themselves. Carnival cruise bought it when there weren't any cruises. Ceazers bought it when no one was gambling. Chevron USA when oil hit all time low. These companies are now imbedded to the service. 

Q: **Why don't companies do these things in house?**

A: The training, and learning, is free. In-house teams can learn this and join the community for free. In-house teams want this instead of trying to build there own.

1618857660.0,119,DD: MVIS go BRRRR and I don't care which way.,"My medium-term bull case for MVIS.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Buy MVIS shares, sell way OTM monthly covered calls for absurd premiums.

&#x200B;

Disclaimer - I wrote this Sunday night after I decided on my course of action. I did not post until now because I wanted to actually do the trades before posting the DD. The numbers herein reflect prices at that time and they have since changed slightly.

&#x200B;

I'm fucking new at this. I got in with GME, I admit it. I'm probably completely fucked on this thesis, and I encourage you all to shit all over it so that I don't lose all my tendies on some batshit weed-induced fantasy. I don't know what I'm doing, and if you follow me you're literally retarded. That being said...

&#x200B;

I yolo'd my entire net worth on MVIS today. I'm poor, so this was only 500 shares, but fuck you. We all start somewhere. I just started late... and waited some more. And then missed the bus.

&#x200B;

Positions:

3 GME @ 238

500 MVIS @ 11.49 avg

\-5 MVIS 521 18c (0.70 premium realized)

&#x200B;

The most important factor in my thesis is the high IV of MVIS. Looking back at the last year, the IV and HV have been consistently high, which given the incredibly swingy nature of this WSB stock is not unexpected.

&#x200B;

In my research, which was probably half-assed and woefully inadequate, a high IV is a stock with above 60% or so, and the top few are above 100. MVIS is at 160%. Historically for the last year, this is not abnormal for MVIS. GME is also around 160% right now.

&#x200B;

High IV means that the options chain is often very expensive. Lots of people are gambling on this stock moving quickly, so you can sell covered calls for inflated premiums.

&#x200B;

Lets do some quick and dirty math.

&#x200B;

For our purposes we will use May 21 exp.

&#x200B;

GME: current 155. 521 300c is 8.35 (strike = \~193% current price)

MVIS: current 11. 521 20c is 0.80 (strike = \~182% current price)

RKT current 22 521 30c is 0.26 (strike = \~136% current price)

&#x200B;

So, lets look at a metric that probably has a name I don't know: (premium / stock price). This tells me that for every dollar I have invested into a stock, I can earn that amount for the option. This lets me rate options based on what I expect returns to be for selling covered calls.

&#x200B;

GME: 5.387%

MVIS: 7.273%

RKT: 1.182% (IV is \~60%)

&#x200B;

At 7.27% returns on a monthly option, if MVIS were to magically trade sideways and also keep its high IV for a year, you would have nearly doubled your money even if the stock ended the year at the exact same price.

&#x200B;

If MVIS drops, it will retain its high IV and you can continue to add shares and sell more monthlies until it rebounds. (Or you can trade the high IV to be much riskier with your pricing until it eventually catches you, hopefully turning a profit in the end - you're a paper handed bitch too)

&#x200B;

If MVIS spikes, you have a lot of opportunity to cash in because you are holding shares. Sure you could have \*bought\* calls instead of selling them, but I want to sell the lottery tickets not buy them.

&#x200B;

MVIS is currently dirt cheap at $11, and has been red all month. I think it's close to its bottom and is about to pop right back up a few bucks.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ok, so let's talk potential gains and losses.

&#x200B;

Because my position is shares, my losses are fairly limited as I believe based on absolutely no evidence except a couple charts I saw once that there is a fairly hard floor of about $7 that it'll just never drop past again ever. Therefore my maximum loss is maybe $5/share. If I can get 0.80 premiums every month, then in six months I've basically covered my loss and can exit a slightly wiser ape. Or double down and keep selling the IV (This. I'll do this. It's just a dip. Buy more!)

&#x200B;

If the stock trades sideways for months and sheds its IV, then I continue to sell calls until I think I can get higher gains elsewhere, and I exit the position with less profit than I had hoped, but no losses.

&#x200B;

If the stock spikes but does not pass my strike, I roll the options out (and possibly up) and try to capitalize on the short term spike in IV and premiums. I keep holding until either the IV or stock price drops below levels I am happy with.

&#x200B;

If the stock spikes past my strike (currently $18) then I am assigned and exit the trade +$3,250 plus any premiums I got.

&#x200B;

In summary: I don't care if this stock moons, plunges, or charts a path like the fucking Evergiven as long as its IV stays high. I'm just gonna build my position and sell lotto tickets to people even dumber than me.

&#x200B;

I'm pretty confident in this, so I'm probably fucked. Please teach me. If you want charts and graphs, fuck you do your own DD. If you want rocket emojis, this thread is accepting donations.

The S&P500 opened Monday 4/19/21 at 4179.80, just below the previous close of 4185.67 on Friday  
4/16/21.

Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) prepare to square up over the social media platforms controversial  
tracking of consumer data. Facebook, which generates a large portion of its profits from targeted advertising, is known to collect consumer data to deliver the ads it believes will be the most successful. Apple has been in the process of developing what it calls “App Tracking Transparency,” for its devices and announced in January that the feature will be included and enabled by default on all new Apple operating systems. The technology, which was tested publicly in summer of 2020, will prevent applications like Facebook and Instagram from being able to collect user data. Facebook has begun preparations to sue Apple, who is currently in the midst of a lawsuit over App Store payments for the popular online game, Fortnite.

Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke on the issue following statements from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg citing Apple as their, “biggest competitor.” Tim appeared committed to continuing to roll out the technology, saying, “Technology does not need vast troves of personal data, stitched together across dozens of websites and apps, in order to succeed. Advertising existed and thrived for decades without it. And we’re here today because the path of least resistance is rarely the path of wisdom. If a business is built on misleading users, on data exploitation, on choices that are no choices at all, then it does not deserve our praise. It deserves reform.”

Apple will hold its first product showcase of the year tomorrow, 4/20/21. The technology frontrunner is suspected to unveil our first glimpses of consumer-grade Augmented Reality technologies. The product showcase comes on the heels of a great month for the emerging AR industry, which was just the subject of a $20 Billion military contract with Microsoft. Apple is up 0.86% on the market open.

Emerging fitness company Peloton (PTON) traded down 5% on the open following federal regulators warnings against treadmills sold by the company. The Consumer Product Safety Commission released statements April 17th warning parents of children and pet owners to exercise caution after the death of a child who became wedged underneath the machine. At least 40 incidents of injury related to the machine have been recorded since its release.

Reports of Google (GOOG) using foreign tax loopholes to evade taxes have emerged. The company reportedly used the “double-Irish,” loophole to funnel over 100 Billion in profits through Ireland and into Bermuda in 2018 & 2019, allowing the company to collect the profits free of U.S. taxation. The loophole was addressed and abolished by the U.K. in 2015, however the nature of the change to legislation still allows companies established before it’s passing to exploit the loophole. A spokeswoman for Google indicated that the loophole is no longer being used by the company, and that the U.S. taxes avoided by using the loophole would have amounted to approximately 80% of all taxes levied against the profits.

The September 2020 agreement to merge NVIDIA (NVDA) and ARM Ltd. is currently in limbo as U.K. regulators have released statements intervening in the acquisition. The merger, which was negotiated by NVIDIA and SoftBank, is worth approximately $40 Billion. The intervention was released this morning, 4/19/21, and carries with it the stipulation that a full federal investigation be conducted and completed by the end of July 30th, 2021. The state of the deal is uncertain as markets await a press release from NVIDIA.

JP Morgan (JPM) has displayed considerable interest in funding a new professional soccer league in Europe. The European Super League, which was announced on Sunday by a dozen of the world’s largest football clubs, will be established to rival the current European Champions League, and will consist of 12 of Europe’s leading clubs, mostly from Spain and the U.K. A spokeswoman for JP Morgan confirmed in an email that it would be involved in funding the league, but the amount in which JP Morgan will be contributing is still unknown. JP Morgan posted earnings of 12.61 last week and was up 0.5% on the market open.

TLDR: PLTR is game-changing tech, has a deep moat and a huge TAM. But, the stock has been beaten down...and without any upside catalyst...will likely break the $21 support level and grind down to $15...or lower. I exited my position and have buy order at $15...all tendies will be reinvested in more PLTR shares.


AMAZING COMPANY
Much DD has been provided on WSB...so I won’t go into too much repetitive detail.
- PLTR software is potentially world-changing.
- They been developing/optimizing this software for over a decade...funded by DOD/DARPA.
- Their B2B play is just ramping-up...they’ll likely be working with 50%+ of the F500 in 5 years.
- Their competitive Moat is Challenger Deep.


UNFORTUNATELY, NO UPSIDE CATALYSTS UNTIL EARNINGS IN MAY
Lots of downside catalysts: 
- Insider Selling 
- Wall St/Pro investors still don’t fundamentally understand PLTR.
- Management shunning Wall St...not playing the quarterly results game.
- The DoubleClick Demo Day last week was a dud...a real missed opportunity...PLTR didn’t manage expectations...the presenters looked into space somewhere off camera...and awkwardly read instead of presenting the amazing tech...they also went too far into the weeds...only presented 2 client categories...and never presented PLTR client results...the stock literally dropped from $26 to $23 in a day...and is still grinding lower.


BRILLIANT UNIQUE CEO
- Love Papa Karp...and he is building a world-changing company.
- But, when the CEO literally tells people not to buy “short term”...what kind of message does this send? 
- Who wants to buy a stock and watch it grind lower without any upside catalysts?
- Pro investor have many shiny objects to chase.
- Retail investors don’t have unlimited dry powder to buy the dips.


UPSIDE CATALYST
I do believe May earnings will be an upside catalyst.  The stakes couldn’t be higher.

1618850463.0,7,CGNT likely to be acquired by NNDM," **TL;DR**: Cognyte (CGNT) will very likely be acquired by Nano-Dimensions (NNDM), in a form of merger called a Reverse Triangular Merger, for a number of reasons including: highly synergistic offerings, favorable tax treatment and government funding given enjoyed by both Israeli companies, posturing and hiring of new executives in the defense space with head of M&A being recent president at Verint systems division which was spun-off to become CGNT as of February 2021. The combined entity would be profitable due to CGNT’s expanding margins and revenues along with NNDM’s large cash position and cash burn that is manageable on the combined balance sheet. Additionally the combined entity would be an industry leader with more offerings and capabilities globally than their competitors of Palantir or Fire Eye. The acquisition will occur quickly and likely be funded significantly from NNDM stock and the rest cash. Given the mismatch of market caps and estimated BV multiple of 7x-10x CGNT shareholders will be winners in the merger transaction, achieving a very favorable stock-to-stock exchange rate + cash consideration. Conservative estimated total value per share realized from CGNT shareholders of 40% relative to current share price with 16% low end premium if deal terms inked in the past few months are realized mark to market.

**Why CGNT as Acquisition Target**

· NNDM has been highly vocal that they are planning an Acquisition for some time

· From the 20-F SEC filings from both companies they state that there are tax and royalties penalties from merging/acquiring a non-Israeli company along with manufacturing products outside of Israel, which CGNT does have manufacturing plant in Israel. Acquisition target would likely need to be an Israeli Company

· Both companies receive funding from the IIA which is a material part of project funding, with ramifications from merging/acquiring non-Israeli company.

· CGNT is the cyber threat and security spin off of Verint with the spin off occurring Feb 1, 2021. They are profitable with their growth strategy being expanding enterprise customer base, growing deeper with existing customers, adding verticals. This fits well with NNDM as they can aid expansion of verticals for both enterprise and government via production of and protection of enterprise/5G/security operations devices (CGNT provides IP data theft identification and prevention which is critical for NNDM to serve large enterprise customers)

· From the AME Academy NNDM demos different device capabilities of their systems including 5g, implantable/tattooable sensors which would be synergistic for CGNT security operations

· CGNT business model of software as a service meshes perfectly with NNDM’s plan to transition business model to software side from purely a manufacturer

· CGNT is profitable, the spin-off only makes sense if it was done for the purpose of a sale, 4 of 7 CGNT board members are current Verint board members/executives

· Hanan Gino appointed Chief Product Officer and Head of Strategic M&A: He was most recently in charge of the division of Verint that becam

**Why a Reverse Triangular Merger**

· The licensing agreement between Verint and CGNT only allow critical IP to be used if they are using for existing business activities and are not acquired by a 3rd party. The agreement does allow to be used by affiliates via sublicensing.

· A reverse triangular merger allows the acquisition to take place while keeping critical licensing contracts intact for CGNT

· The target (CGNT) must own substantially all of its assets and perform substantially the same business activities in order to qualify.

· The benefit of this type of transaction allows the acquisition to take place tax free if certain conditions are met, 80% of consideration is stock of acquirer and not more than 20% cash (might act differently due to different Israeli regulations)

· This kind of transaction can be performed quickly with minimal regulatory and shareholder actionse CGNT

· CGNT wording within their 20-F filling allows them to pass a merger/acquisition with 25% shareholder approval, classified as Emerging Growth Company and aren’t required to disclose proxy statements. They will easily be able to pass the merger without going through public shareholder announcement.

**What will NNDM need to Pay**

· Current CGNT market cap of $1.6ish billion

· Recent filing from CGNT lists Book Value of the company as $301.5M

· Using some conservative multiples of 7x-10x book value using competitors like FireEye, Palantir and IBM we get a Price of $2.7B to acquire CGNT (8.7x Book Value, $40 per share)

· Value at Current NNDM Share Price: At 80% of the consideration being stock to be tax free the exchange rate of CGNT to NNDM shares would need to be around 4 shares of NNDM for every 1 share of CGNT in addition to $8 per share in cash. This isn’t possible currently given that would exceed NNDM current shares outstanding so the cash consideration would need to be more or the agreed value of NNDM shares be higher (trading between 12-16 when CGNT was spun-off)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i29q5aetr5u61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0d0d4f63f00ec617da03ca8ca9602afac22473a

Highlighted prices are around CGNT spin off

· If the agreed value is at the recent direct offering at 12.8 per share of NNDM then the consideration paid would be 2.5 shares of NNDM for every share of CGNT and an $8 per share cash consideration. (This exact case likely would not occur unless SP rises or considerably more cash is paid above the tax consequence of breaching 20% cash – Virent still controls board and needs to ensure significant value is provided to former shareholders and justify spin-off)

· NNDM has the ability and spare cash to repurchase shares in order to drive price up in order to get NNDM market price up the pre-determined exchange rate value

· SEC Filing on Feb 15. 2021 amends the company’s articles to allow the board to call upon shares from shareholders giving further latitude for forcing acquisition if need be

**Other Notes and Consideration**

Options Activity

· Both CGNT and NNDM have extremely high options activity for May expirations

· NNDM Put/Call Open interest ratio of 0.53 indicates strong bearish sentiment

· CGNT Put/Call Open interest ratio of 0.06 and Put/Call volume of 0.01 indicates extremes in bearish sentiment but the extremeness of the value implies the opposite, being a major turning point

CGNT is required to pay Verint a one time cash dividend of $35m, being an impact per share of $0.51, theoretically this should already be priced in but the merger announcement would likely be after this payment is complete.

CGNT has affiliations with a blank cheque company according to the SEC website indicating that the merger has already been planned as a blank cheque company is required for a Reverse Triangular Merger.

**Risk Factors**

· NNDM stock is driven further down or doesn’t recover and the deal goes through anyway at unfavorable terms

· The combination of the two entities are viewed negatively and value is lost

· I completely misinterpreted the SEC fillings and Israeli tax laws

· The deal does not go through and the standalone CGNT entity is worth far less than expected

· CGNT was left with unknown liabilities passed off from Verint

· CGNT financials are misstated and fraudulent

**Conclusion**

While I think that NNDM will acquire CGNT if I am wrong about that I still believe that CGNT is an acquisition target for another company based on my findings.

If a merger doesn’t happen CGNT is still a strong play in their sector and has strong growth and profitability in the same industry as Palantir which saw ridiculous amounts of interest. I think the risks associated with this play are managed well, my view of probability of high returns in a short amount of time make for excellent risk adjusted return potential.

**○ 4.1 Orladeyo**™ **(Berotralstat) oral pill**

&#x200B;

Orladeyo is the *first Oral approved* treatment used to prevent swelling attacks in people with *hereditary angioedema (HAE)*, disease which is estimated to affect *1 in 50,000 people*.

Berotralstat is currently approved in two countries. On December the 3rd it got approved by the FDA in the *USA*, and on January the 22nd in *Japan*. The company expects approval of Orladeyo in *Europe* to happen early Q2 2021.

&#x200B;

CEO himself Jon Stonehouse confirmed in the [last conference call, ( 22:15 )](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/mqqo89/bcrx_biocryst_apr_14_2021_at_845_am_edt_20th/) Orladeyo will annually be generating $500MM plus revenue.

\-Serge Belanger ( Analyst ): I think in the past you've talked about sales potential for Orladeyo of 500 million plus, are you still reiterating that target?

\- Stonehouse ( CEO ): Yeah make sure you remember the plus.

&#x200B;

Before oral Orladeyo was approved for HAE, patients would only have treatments that required usage of *needles*. This dramatically reduced the *quality of their life*, making some of them quit using the treatment. That's the main reason why Orladeyo is a game changer.

After the approval, surveys on patients were done, showing a large number of new patients that were not treated before due to needles, now willing to be treated taking an oral form pill, Orladeyo.

As it's shown in[ the January 2021 Corporate Presentation](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 13), in their recently undergone survey 59% of the patients expressed high willingness to use Orladeyo, and that number rised to 71% with Physician recommendation.

&#x200B;

Additional surveys were undergone on patients using treatments from the competition ""Cynrize, Haegarda, Takhzyro"" and the results were[ the following ones](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 14).

* **4.1.1** **Pricings/Revenue**

&#x200B;

**USA**

In the USA there currently are 10,000 patients, 7500 diagnosed and treated, 1700 diagnosed but not treated, 600 treated but not diagnosed.

Physicians expect to prescribe Orladeyo for over 41% of HAE patients. Conservatively thinking, taking 7,500 patients ( the diagnosed and treated ones ) out of the total 10,000 pool in the USA, with over[ 41% of patients prescription](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) ( page 16 ) we would conservatively aim for 3,075 patients.

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in the USA, is equal to 485,000$

&#x200B;

**Japan**

On November the 5th Biocryst undergone an agreement with Torii Pharmaceuticals. A local Japanese company that will be in charge of getting new patients to be treated with Orladeyo in Japan and commerzialing it.

The day Orladeyo received the approval in Japan, Goichi Matsuda, president of Torii said the following words ""Until now, HAE patients in Japan had no therapies approved to prevent attacks, so the approval of Orladeyo marks a significant advance in HAE treatment"", ""We are pleased to have the opportunity to bring the first oral treatment option to Japanese HAE patients and are actively preparing for the commercialization"".

Japan has around 2,500 HAE patients, and Biocryst conservatively expects to at least reach 500 patients.

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in Japan, is equal to $248,500

Approval of Orladeyo in Japan issued a $15MM milestone payment from Torii.

BioCryst will receive tiered royalties ranging from 20% - 40% of Japanese sales.

&#x200B;

**Europe**

It's estimated to be around 12,000 HAE patients in Europe. Following the physician prescription of over[ 41% of patients to prescribe](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16) for Orladeyo. We get a total of 4,920 patients in Europe.

Since pricings and jurisdictions work in a different way in Europe, the amount of money each patient will have to pay for Orladeyo is expected to be around or above Japan's $248,500/year. This number should soon be confirmed.

Approval in Europe expected to happen early Q2 2021.

&#x200B;

With this yearly prices and the amount of patients defined before, we get the following results.

&#x200B;

USA - 3,075p x 485K = 1,491,375,000$

Japan - 500p x 248,5K  = 124,250,000$

EU - 4,920p x 248,5K = 1,222,620,000$

&#x200B;

Summing it all up we get $2,751,270,000. From that number we have to subtract 123,100,000$ making it a total of $2,628,170,000. The sustraction happens as a result of the undergone Royalty agreement with Torii Pharmaceuticals and Royalty Pharma.

* **4.1.2 Orladeyo value**

Having in mind the discussed numbers before, Orladeyo alone will be generating $2,628,170,000 a year, using the average mid-cap Biotech company multiplier x7. We get a total of $18,397,190,000 meaning an increase of $104,46 in the stock price.

**○ 4.2 Peramivir** ™ **(Rapivab)**

Peramivir (Rapivab) is an antiviral drug for the treatment of influenza. Peramivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor, acting as a transition-state analogue inhibitor of influenza neuraminidase and thereby preventing new viruses from emerging from infected cells. It is approved for intravenous administration.

On 19 December 2014, the FDA approved Peramivir to treat influenza infection in adults. Peramivir has also been approved in Japan and South Korea and is available in Japan as Rapiacta and in South Korea as Peramiflu.

The U.S. government (department of Health and Human Services) gave BioCryst Pharmaceuticals more than $77 million to finish the Phase III clinical development of peramivir. In 2009 the department of Health and Human Services had already given about $180 million to the program.

In 2013 the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA/HHS) released new funding under the current $234.8 million contract to enable completion of a New Drug Application filing for intravenous (IV) peramivir.

Rapivab is a bio-defense drug that is often stockpiled by the government. Last time being September the 26th, with a purchase of $14 million.

&#x200B;

* **4.2.1** **Peramivir value**

With all the explanations given above and having in mind Peramivir is a government bio-defense drug the value of Rapivab can not be less than $500,000,000 conservatively speaking.

Galidesivir (BCX4430) is a broad-spectrum antiviral in advanced development for the treatment of viruses that pose a threat to health and national security, including SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19), Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika.

The NIAID and BARDA have been funding the development and testing of Galidesivir for over 15 years as they recognize its importance in preparation for all future pandemics. The 31st of August, 2020 NIAID Awarded $44 Million Contract to Advance Development of Galidesivir.

Galidesivir has also demonstrated broad-spectrum activity in vitro against more than 20 ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses in nine different families, including coronaviruses, filoviruses, togaviruses, bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses and flaviviruses.  (Hepatitis C, West Nile, Dengue, Jap Encephalitis, Yellow Fever, TBEV, OHFV, and Zika), orthomyxoviruses and picornaviruses..

Galidesivir is the first antiviral that has ever shown such potential, and to top it off, it is now known from the Phase I trial and now the Brazil part 1 trial to clearly be safe and show dose-sensitive effects in people. And based on multiple animal studies, it works equally effectively as a pill that is stable for years at room temperature. Not only that, but this antiviral, unlike any of the others, has excellent penetration of the blood brain barrier as was seen in the macaque Zika virus study.

&#x200B;

* **4.3.1 Efficacy**

Galidesivir was safe and generally well tolerated in Phase 1 clinical safety and pharmacokinetics trials by both intravenous and intramuscular routes of administration in healthy subjects. In animal studies, galidesivir has demonstrated survival benefits against a variety of serious pathogens, including Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika viruses.

NIAID on April 9th 2020 its expansion of the Brazilian yellow fever trial to include three cohorts of 8 severely affected COVID-19 patients, each being given a different IV dose regimen . Unfortunately, but obvious in hindsight, this trial was from the beginning underpowered to determine a clinical benefit. The patients were followed for eight weeks after their treatments.

The company on December 22nd announced that all three doses were perfectly safe for the patients. In addition, they found that patients had a dose-sensitive reduction in virus levels in their lungs. They went on to say that an animal model, showed that Galidesivir significantly reduced COVID-19-associated lung damage.

Despite all this and even though the trial was not even powered to detect a clinical difference in the patients, the NIAID, after finding an insignificant difference in outcomes between the small numbers of drug-treated and placebo-treated patients, inexplicably decided to discontinue clinical trials of it for COVID-19, to the great confused dismay of investors and perhaps even taken advantage of by short hedge funds who brought the stock down in late December.

Bear in mind that during this trial, one of the most lethal strains of COVID-19 we know of was affecting the Brazilian trial sites, later known now as the P.1 or Manaus strain, and could have easily negatively affected the clinical outcomes of this small trial too given that the trial was focused on very sick patients more likely to carry this bad strain.

Interfering with the replication process is a well-established antiviral strategy that has been successfully exploited in developing such life-saving drugs as the nucleoside inhibitors of HIV and acyclovir for herpes simplex complex. This approach could allow a single broad-spectrum drug like galidesivir to address gaps in the U.S. government’s medical countermeasure plan and to possibly replace multiple, pathogen-specific drugs for use in response to both natural outbreaks and bioterrorist threats.

&#x200B;

* **4.3.2 Galidesivir value**

We must have in mind that Galidesivir is a Government funded bio-defense drug, that aims to treat a wide range of viruses as explained before. Its global stockpiling for future pandemics is also an absolute certainty given its long-term stability. With all the given explanations, conservatively talking Galidesivir can not be worth less than $1B this is 5,67$.

&#x200B;

**○ 4.4 FOP - BCX9250**

FOP is an ultra-rare, severely disabling condition characterized by the irregular formation of bone outside the normal skeleton, also known as heterotopic ossification (HO). HO can occur in muscles, tendons and soft tissue. Patients with FOP become bound by this irregular ossification over time, with restricted movement and fused joints, resulting in deformities and premature mortality. There are currently no approved treatments for FOP.

There are an estimated 3,500 to 9,000 patients worldwide, with 900 diagnosed so far. Currently there aren’t any approved treatments.

Market size for this treatment is estimated to reach 500M-900M in 2025, growing to 3B in 2028 as more patients are diagnosed. With a price ranging from $900K-$1M/year.

Last December the 21st Biocryst announced positive Phase 1 results

&#x200B;

“BCX9250 was safe and well tolerated at all doses studied, with linear and dose-proportional exposure supporting once-daily dosing.”.

“In preclinical studies, BCX9250 demonstrated potency for the target kinase, selectivity, safety and strong suppression of HO in animal models.”

&#x200B;

* **4.4.1 BCX9250 Value**

BCX9250 study will most likely take 4 years to finish, this is, until 2025. By then the potential market we will be aimming for, will be $750,000,000 aprox.

Drugs that are in Phase 1 studies are said to have a 10% chance of making it to the market. Following that, BCX9250 as of now shuld be valued at $75,000,000 = 0.43$

**○ 4.5 Oral Factor D inhibitor - BCX9930**

&#x200B;

BCX9930 is a novel, oral, potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of Factor D which recently completed Phase 1 clinical development for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases.

The 3rd of August 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track designation for oral Factor D inhibitor, BCX9930.

This is how Bill Sheridan ( *Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President )* defined [BCX9930 in the last conference call ( 22:00 )](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/mqqo89/bcrx_biocryst_apr_14_2021_at_845_am_edt_20th/)

""*BCX9930 is a really terrifically exciting project, this is a potent specific Factor D inhibitor. So, the mechanism of action is to block the enzymatic activity of that complement enzyme, that enzyme sits at the very start of the alternative pathway of complement. So, that opens up a whole set of opportunities across diferent diseases that are driven by dysregulation of that alternative pathway of complement and the amplification loop that's embedded in that pathway""*

&#x200B;

* **4.5.1** **Staff excitement**

Staff team from Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc seem to be really positive and excited about the incoming future of BCX9930. Such excitement has been seen in the last conference calls where staff members such as the CEO Jon P.Stonehouse, or the Vice President, William P.Sheridan would say the following words.

&#x200B;

*“Embarrassment of riches”*

*“We agree with Alexion that creating a potent specific and great oral Factor D inhibitor is a great challenge, and we are happy we have one”*

*“My only concern is i have no concerns”*

*“Pipeline in a molecule”*

*“My aim is to make c5 inhibitors obsolete”*

*“This is Big”*

""*BCX9930 is a really terrifically exciting project*

&#x200B;

* **4.5.2** **Phase I study**

On March 22, 2021 BCRX announced that[ BCX9930 will be advancing from Ph1 to pivotal trials in PNH](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/7d6e0bdb-fc11-4653-a0cb-a8c64e159082) following the successful proof of concept trial.

The company announced that a Pivotal trial for PNH, and proof of concept trials in renal complement-mediated diseases are expected to begin in 2H 2021.

A pivotal trial is typically a Phase III clinical trial in the multi-year process of clinical research intended to demonstrate and confirm the safety and efficacy of a treat. A successful pivotal trial is required as evidence for drug marketing approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

On March 22, the company unveiled BCX9930 Ph1 data. The most relevant information from that Ph1 is mentioned below.

""100 percent of treatment-naïve patients and 83 percent of C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients were *transfusion-free*. *Prior to the trial*, 22 percent of treatment-naïve patients and 17 percent of C5 inadequate responders were transfusion-free ""

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/09pg7d3nx2u61.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c0170318231a5f2f6cbd3f5e0c650ff34362ddf

"" Hemoglobin levels increased by a mean of 3.5 g/dL in treatment-naïve patients and 3.2 g/dL in C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients; at last visit, mean hemoglobin levels were 11.8 g/dL and 12.2 g/dL, respectively ""

&#x200B;

To understand properly how positive BCX9930 data was, below you can find a photo were the main undergone studies in this kind of inhibitors is shown, with the results they achieved. What mainly should catch your attention is the Hemoglobin change from baseline and the % of transfusion units reduction from baseline - This data has been gathered by Barclays.

&#x200B;

* **4.5.3 Alternative Pathway**

What makes BCX9930 a game changer, is the wide spectrum of Alternative Pathway Dysregulation disease it can treat. It can treat up to[ 8 diseases](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 26) as of now, that's why insiders call it “Pipeline in a molecule”. Those 8 diseases are shown in the pic below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/clm0yytcu2u61.png?width=1273&format=png&auto=webp&s=69a693e243e9bd5fc76b27b28d93ca5482e10c4e

1- PNH (Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria)

2 - aHUS (Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome)

3 - ANCA vasculitis (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis)

4 - Lupus Nephritis

5 - IgAN vasculitis

6 - C3G (Glomerulonephritis)

7 - PMN (Primary membranous nephropathy)

8 - IgAN (IgA nephropathy)

&#x200B;

* **4.5.4 Potential market size by 2025**

Assuming BCX9930 will be approved by 2025, and it will be able to treat the previously mentioned 8 diseases, we reach to the following conclusion. The potential market size BCX9930 will be aiming for by 2025 scores up to $28,56B - $51B / year. This numbers are explained below, stating the yearly market size each of those 8 diseases aim for.

&#x200B;

1 - 2 ""  [Due to COVID-19, the market for PNH and aHUS was anticipated to grow from US$ 4855 million in 2020 to US$ **7023 million** by 2026; it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.89% during 2021–2026.](https://www.marketresearch.com/QYResearch-Group-v3531/Global-PNH-aHUS-Size-Status-13306748/)""

3 - “ Anca vasculitis prevalence in the USA rounds 10-20 per million = 3300-6600 patients. As a treatment example we use Soliris, which costs $500,000/year. We would aim for 1,65B - 3.3B market size as of now. Expected to grow by 2025""

4 - “"" The global systemic lupus erythematosus market size is expected to reach USD 3.08 billion by 2025, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc., exhibiting a CAGR of 7.0% during the forecast period. ""

5 - 8 “""IgAN. The gathered disease prevalence data varies according to in which coutry the study has been undergone. Data gathered from the undergone study in East Asia, show the prevalence rounds  45 / million. meaning 14,850 patients, or a potential 7,25B market size using Soliris's yearly price  ""

6 - ""C3G:  Prevalence in the USA round 14-140 per 1M people = 4620-46,200 patients. If those patients were to be treated with Soliris which costs $500,000 / year, the potential market size we aim for rounds  2,31B - 23,1B ""

7 - "" PMN prevalence is similar to the one of IgAN, so we would potentially aim for a similar market size, meaning 7.25B""

&#x200B;

* **4.5.5 Alexion buy out**

On December the 12th, 2020 Alexion announced that AstraZeneca was going to buy them out for 39B. More than 90% of their revenue come from their “""""Factor D""""”  C5 inhibitor, being that the main reason why AstraZeneca wanted that buy out to happen.

You might think, why does this matter? Well, remember we have a Factor D which has shown to be more effective than Alexion’s, and is able to treat more diseases than they do aswell. This buy out reflects how undervalued BCX9930 is.

Apart from the buy out, I think it's essential to mention that Alexion bought Achillion's ""Factor D"" when it was in Ph2 for $930MM.

In 2019 Alexion's SOLIRIS® (eculizumab) net product sales were $3,946.4 million. Soliris is currently approved to treat PNH and aHUS. Have in mind BCX9930 is able to treat 8 diseases, aiming for a wider market, while having greater efficacy/safety profile.

As a quick example, using the average biotech mid-cap x7 revenue multiplier, and the revenue Soliris managed to generate in 2019,  3,964B = 27,748B. It would mean a SP value of $157.56 for BCRX. I want to make clear again that BCX9930 is said to be best in-class treatment and it's able to treat more diseases, therefore aims for a bigger revenue opportunity.

&#x200B;

* **4.5.6 Phase II study**

Despite the company not PR'ing the start of the phase II study of BCX9930, the official page of[ clinacal trials](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04702568), show that the start of phase II study was December the 18th, 2020. This is extremely bullish since it reasures our thoughts that Ph I data readout will be good and enough to keep the study going.

&#x200B;

* **4.5.7 Soliris/Ultomoris patients survey**

BCRX recently did a survey with 23 patients, 12 of them using Ultomiris and the other 11 Soliris. The survey showed that 91% of the patients were interested in switching due to the reasons explained in the pic below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uud6ce7rx2u61.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8d90f157a39f94bf07330e06c159887435da70d

Some of the patients treated with BCX9930 were asked some questions, among them, the 6th one expressed his desire to be able to be treated with BCX9930 oral pill. As we have seen it before with Orladeyo, patients are highly willing to switch from needles to oral-pill form treatments.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/niewqlqsx2u61.png?width=1462&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8cba43280c8411a0b425c4974ce860115731620

&#x200B;

* **4.5.8 BCX9930 From a Ph1 to a Ph3**

On March 22, 2021 BCX9930 PNH Ph1 data was shown, the obtained results were so good that it enabled BCX9930 jump from a[ Ph1 to a pivotal Ph3 trial in PNH](https://adisinsight.springer.com/trials/700335293), totally skipping the Ph2.

Additional proof of concept BCX9930[ Ph2 trials in Renal Complement-Mediated diseases](https://adisinsight.springer.com/trials/700335296) will be made.

Straight jumping from a[ ph1 to a pivotal ph3](https://adisinsight.springer.com/trials/700335293) trial, is something that's not common in the bio world and could be taken as a really bullish sign. Apart from it being a bullish sign, it accelerates the process of development of the drug, giving it a chance to hit the market in a smaller span of time. The quicker the drug is in the market the better, and the more value it brings for investors.

&#x200B;

**4.5.9** **BCX9930 valuation**

Having in mind BCX9930 is a potential *best-in-class treatment*, that Alexion got bought out for 39B mainly for their “Factor D” c5 inhibitor, and the yearly market size BCX9930 aims for in 2025 rounds the $28,56B - $51B mark. BCX9930 valuation can not be less than a 30% of Alexion’s buy out price, this is 11.7B meaning 66.44$.

&#x200B;

[BCX9930 value: 66.44$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/c8fck3ytx2u61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=2622d005e26eab918e1d33ae84bfe605f34b90a3)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **5. Strong BO Buy Out candidate**

As we have explained in the Institutional section before, all good bio-tech investors do know who Alexander J.Denner founder of Sarissa Capital is. After recently increasing his stake in BCRX, along with BlackRock, he now owns a 5% of Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Denner, has increased his position in BCRX by an stunning 789% in the last 3 quarters, showing strong conviction in the company.

Since Denner opened his position in Alexion, it took him 5 months to close the buy out deal, as shown in the picture below

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6y598y4yx2u61.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c5ce6aa1e60151aea85e69eaa850c8f3362f8e7

After this exhaustive analysis on the company, we can easily acknowledge that BCRX is more than a strong BO candidate. A buy out coming from BIIB, company where Denner forms part of the BOD board of directors, would make total sense in the following 2 years once BCX9930 Factor D phase III data is unveiled.

&#x200B;

It also is important to mention that Bank of America added BCRX to the list of top M&A candidates         ( Mergers and Acquisitions ) as of October 30th, 2020. Stating how they believe BCRX will have a strong revenue growth in the incoming years.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **6. Alexion's performance with Soliris**

As we have explained before, Alexion Pharmaceuticals has its own """"""""Factor D""""""""  C5 inhibitor inhibitor called Soliris.

Alexion could be the perfect example to have an idea of what we could expect from Biocryst's in the incoming years. From 2007 to 2014 Alexion's stock price grew a 1777%. Being valued at 10.5$ in 2007 and 186.6$ in 2014.

Revenue generated by Alexion gradually grew up as their Factor D was approved to treat additional diseases, and the market size it captured became wider.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j8gvx3g2y2u61.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=d69e305f2683f4cc9681224addf471655fa54038

Biocryst Pharmaceuticals managing to do the SP move Alexion did, is more than doable with the unique pipeline it possess. Having in mind Alexion made 66.4 MM revenue the first year while BCRX at least expects to generate 500 MM plus with Orladeyo, apart from it, additional revenue generated by Rapivab/Galidesivir stockpillings may come. Incoming Earning Reports are meant to be potential catalysts for the company, gradually becoming more meaningful as the market size they capture with Orladeyo becomes wider.

&#x200B;

* **7.** **De-risked company**

Last December the 7th, 2020 BCRX announced they made a Royalty agreement with Royalty Pharma and Athyrium Capital Management. With this agreement BCRX was funded with $325,000,000 in order to support Orladeyo launch. Setting the company in an attractive position of not needing to do any money rising ""Offering"".

Jon Stonehouse CEO, also confirmed that the company will not need to do offerings anymore. The fact that the company is already generating revenue with Orladeyo is another strong evidence that confirms money risings will not be needed anymore.

It's important to restate that as part of the Royalty agreement, Royalty Pharma will receive a 1% on global net sales of BCX9930, if approved. Showing how bullish they are on BCX9930 and their willingness to invest at it.

&#x200B;

* **8. Forward looking statements**

&#x200B;

1. From now on EarningReports should be catalysts and positive for the company, obtaining better results each quarter as the company settles down and receives additional approvals for Orladeyo in different countries.
2. Orladeyo approval in Europe / Germany launch.
3. The company will have to provide some colour on the BCX9930 PNH pivotal trial, how it will be planned etc etc... Aswell as the PH2 trials in complement-mediated diseases.
4. BCX9250 Next steps should soon be shared by the company
5. BCX4430 Galidesivir recently completed a Ph1, additional information about the study may be given. It's important to mention that this study was fully funded by the NIAID. Next steps for Galidesivir trials may soon be given.
6. Galidesivir/Rapivab stockpilling.

&#x200B;

* **9. Conclusion**

After this exhaustive analysis, we come to the conclusion that BCRX is severely undervalued, and if we sum up the true value of the pipeline, it should be valued around 180$. The StockPrice fair value  number will keep growing as we keep getting data updates from the on-going studies and Orladeyo revenues keep growing, making it an excellent long-term hold and buy out candidate.

I currently do have a position in this company, my average entry price being around the 4$ range. My initial plan is to hold the shares for the long term, at least 2 years more provided that we don't get bought out earlier. I expect the StockPrice to keep rising as Orladeyo revenues flow in and BCX9930 trials keep progressing, aswell as the rest of the pipeline."
1618838571.0,115,Supply Chain Disruptions and You: A Discussion,"OK, so, I have a thought and I want your opinion on it. I've been trying to figure out why the market has been so choppy lately, even things like Semiconductors where they literally can't physically make enough to meet demand. There's a six month wait to buy a new refrigerator, and I haven't seen my favorite coffee product in over three weeks. 

Then it hit me. My coffee isn't out of stock because of unprecedented demand, it's because the supply chain is *so* disrupted that they can't get the resources they need to make it. I'll bet it's the same thing with Semis and appliances and all that. But how can that be? There was that ship disrupting trade for a few days, but I think a lot of people (myself included) are forgetting that it takes *time* to bring products to market -the more complicated the product or its components the longer it takes.

Covid. We crashed hard when the effects of Covid were first becoming apparent, but since then we've recovered, right? **Wrong.** Those disruptions have been working their way through the supply chain for the last year and they're just now starting to hit for more complex products as manufacturers draw down their reserves and find that their suppliers have been doing the same. Maybe the *raw* materials are available again, but that doesn't matter if it's going to take a few more months to turn those raw materials into components.

*If* that's the case, it could explain why industries like tech have been underperforming of late. There's a mismatch between the perception that we're returning to normality and the reality that we're still feeling the aftershocks of a nearly global shutdown in manufacturing and trade.

*If* that's the case, here's what *I'm* thinking is the play:

* Indices: Continue to moon. Sectors are coming back online and once reality catches up to perception even the laggards like tech will start to contribute again and there's nowhere to go but up. 

* High Industry: 🦘 Gang for a few months. This is where the majority of the disconnect is. They're not working flat out trying desperately to meet demand, the demand is there but they *can't* meet it because they haven't got the material to produce more than a pittance of what's required. How long did disruptions at the bottom of the stack last? That's how long these guys are going to bounce around as people variously pile back in but as many leave because they realize there's still a ways to go before the tippy top of the manufacturing stack is stable again.

* Retail: Tepid to mildly bullish. You can't sell what you can't have, but they've got a lot of pent up demand, and when they start getting things back in stock I reckon the ones that have survived will feed the bulls quite nicely. 

* Raw Materials/Mid Level MFG/ Transportation: Either back to normal or Moon baby. Depends, really. They're likely struggling to meet demand as well, but I feel more bullish on them overall. Their consumers are the ones who just can't get enough of what they want -High Industry. And they *can* be working flat out. This is where I'm personally leaning toward dropping my cash for a while. For them it seems like the disruption has largely passed and I'll be expecting big things over the next few months. The counterpoint, I suppose, would be that it's more or less business as usual for them, so there may not be a true moon shot.

That brings me to the final thing I'd like to discuss. Idiosyncratic vs Systemic risk. I've been talking in broad terms about entire industries or groups of industries, but let's face it, indices are a little boring. They're boring because thanks to diversification they're a bit safer than their constituent parts in isolation. This seems like a personal risk tolerance question -are you happy taking the risk that Bob's Copper Refinery is going to win the big contract (or not) or are you more comfortable riding the broader recovery through some copper specific ETF that I haven't found yet (at least not any that can be discussed here)? That's really a question only you can answer, but I'll let you in on a little secret: the big boys don't do either. They diversify, but just enough that their idiosyncratic risk (the risk that an individual company runs into headwinds specific to them) is mitigated. Even making a bet on two different companies in the same industry can *dramatically* reduce your idiosyncratic risk. You're still at the mercy of *systemic* risk (see the ARKs), but there's no avoiding that.

I'm curious what others think about all this. Am I completely off base? Is there a better way to play the final gasps of last year's shitshow? Tune in next time on, ""Madman Presents: The Slow Descent Into Bankruptcy"" to find out!"

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

1618834856.0,261,It is safer to drive a Tesla than other brands in general. Do you feel this is a true stat or because of the people who buy Tesla's," 

[CEO Elon Musk](http://https//www.foxbusiness.com/category/elon-musk) claimed that Tesla vehicles with Autopilot engaged are now approaching a 10 times lower chance of an accident than the average vehicle. 

In the first quarter of 2021, the company registered one accident for every 4.19 million miles driven with Autopilot engaged. For those driving without Autopilot but with the Tesla's active safety features, the company registered one accident for every 2.05 million miles driven. As for those driving without Autopilot or active safety features, the company registered one accident for every 978,000 miles driven. 

In comparison, the most recent data from the National Highway Transportation Security Administration, the auto industry's top safety regulator, finds that there is an automobile crash in the United States every 484,000 miles. "

In a couple years most of the OEMs will be featuring siriusxm similar to terrestrial radio.  I will not be surprised if the dealers will be offering siriusxm radio for 3 to 5 years as a standard part of the transaction.  

Let it make it clear.  I am not advocating sirius xm as a service but rather as a Business whose $1.668 B fcf in 2020 is 8 more than spotify's and probably more than all streamers combined.  For some reason, most folks associate the company with siriusxm radio only.  This was the case five years ago, and a huge mistake to think now.  Today, siriusxm owns Pandora, is the leading digital ads technology  thanks to AdsWizz and Simplecast, that just surpassed 1 B monthly downloads, owns about 15% of SoundCloud, and 100% of Stitcher, on of the top 4 podcasts in the country.  I expect the share price to double already this year with Q1 to be a blowout quarter.

P/E ratio with not full year report for 2020 (1.15bln zl net profit and income 2.14bln) ----> 15.41!!!! Share price - 176zl For example Take Two Interactive is with P/E 41.86!!! (With floor price)

I know that GTA maker is a king but listen this. CDR till 20.12.2020 sold 13mln copys of CP77 (+/- 230zl each)

There was a lot of bugs so they made money back but no body know about this: money back was only for buyers who bought game before 14.12.2020 and there was only period time to get this money back 14.12 - 21.12.2020 if some1 bought it after doesnt count, if some1 came for money back after 21.12 - doesnt count.

Full year report will be on 22.04.2021. Why it is so important? Cuz they made so much money but I think it was only on the game, you should know that they have also fun shop. If you want buy all item just once It's: $2.9k!!!(80items, shirts, jackets, statues, backpacks etc.)

I'm just geussing How much money they made with game and how much with fun shop. If you will count only 13mln sold copys it looks like you get this net profit...

4. Monster Slayer - Witcher as a ""Pokemon Go""
5. Digital Scapes - Vancouver studio, CDR bought them to grow and have more employees to work on 2 games AAA in same time
6. GOG.com - cdr games platform something like Epic Store, they are working very strongly on it to get 100% cash from selling own games and also for selling other dev. games.

Let's establish some things right off the bat - this is NOT about a short squeeze, not about some sexy, currently under-radar but you get the first dibs anything, not about self driving vehicles nor EV's, clean energy; not super hi-tech, definitely not about freaky, minority reportish data analytic enterprise and obviously not about GME (full disclosure - i currently hold 225 shares of GME)

This is about ADAPTHEALTH CO ($AHCO) -  a national leader in providing patient-centric and technology-enabled chronic disease management solutions including **home** healthcare equipment, medical supplies **to the home** and related services **in the United  States**. (note the ""home"" and ""in the US"")

Let me premise further by saying that one of many ""investment"" strategies I try to employ is to seek out what I call a ""Silly Drop/Pop Opportunities"" and take action accordingly.

By Silly Drop/Pops I mean the instances where the market/investors, imo, considerably over-react to an event/news/development directly or indirectly related to the company and/or co's core business and depending on the circumstances either disproportionately reward/push-up SP or punish/drive it down.

Some of the recent profitable examples, where i took action, are:

$AMD - last week, gets cut down 5%+ mid-flight during a strong upward momentum on news NVDA developing data-center CPU (i have posted DD on this and made a little bit of profit but AMD recovered from drop in two days and then some)

$HGEN - surges up from about $15 to $29 overnight in late March after it was announced that management will host a conference call and webcast to discuss topline results from the Phase 3 clinical trial of  lenzilumab in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. ; i've noticed, often w biopharma the initial SP gains do not hold, at least in short run, didn't post DD but did enter a long put position right away on the spike and closed w decent size profit few days later...

There were def some un-profitable (FNKO; AMTX; UPST - i got the direction right but sucked bad at timing mainly due to going for FD's rather than giving my thesis longer time horizon to play out)

But i digress w examples and by now i'm sure you get the idea...

Let's take a closer look at our silly drop candidate:

**$AHCO (52 wk range: $13.60 - $41.58 // FR 4/17 close - $29.17) // next ER 5/6 BMO**

Last week Tuesday 4/13 $AHCO SP dropped more than 20% after it was reported that the companies Co-CEO (that's right there are two) Luke McGee has been formerly charged with tax fraud ..........

So you say ***greenday*** you got's to be shitting dude: ""Co-CEO - not - Co-CEO but top executive officer is being formerly charged w tax fraud and you're tryna tell us this is a decent opp?????!!!!!""

and I say **YES** because

**first** \- guy got charged (not convicted)

**second** \- he got charged in .... waaaaait for it..... IN DENMARK idk what's up w that but business is in US only remember

**third** \- it was FOR SOME PERSONAL shit that he, so far, allegedly, ran in 2014-2015 and which has NO CONNECTION to AHCO business...

**fourth** \- AHCO has a ""back-up"" CEO fully competent and Co immediately took action suspending Luke ""The Great Dane"" McGee and issuing a statement

You can find the statement on Co's site, and copy below for your smooth-brained convenience:

[AdaptHealth-Board-Statement-4-13-21-VFinal-1.pdf](https://www.adapthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AdaptHealth-Board-Statement-4-13-21-VFinal-1.pdf)

**fifth -** lets take a closer look at was going on for the company prior to ""The Danish Affair"" shall we...

lets start with last ER - (all details and transcript available on Co's site)

As you can see from the report the business has been experiencing healthy growth and the company had the ballzz to issue **Increased Guidance** going into 2021 **( think about it - after all the business is designed for stay-at-home**

The loss is primarily (as i understand it) due to expansion via financing of purchases of other companies with complimentary businesses

**sixth** \- according to article in the link below a number of hedgies increased their position in AHCO, most notably Jay Pee EM (if you actually can read and will read the article don't be put off by the title - the ""authors"" only presented the PUT side of the option potential - i'll address the CALL side later in the DD)

**seventh:** \- upgrades and adjustments in chronological order (prior to news; also post news - i view those as somewhat positive even where PT is lowered as new, lowered PT is still significantly higher than current SP)

\- Canaccord Genuity lifted their price objective on shares of AdaptHealth from $39.00 to $50.00 and gave the stock a ""buy"" rating in a research note on Thursday, January 7th

\-  Bank of America began coverage on shares of AdaptHealth in a research note on Tuesday, January 26th. They set a ""buy"" rating and a $46.00 price objective for the company

\- [**Zacks Investment Research**](https://www.zacks.com/registration/premium/login/?adid=AMERBMN_CONTENT_ZER) upgraded shares of AdaptHealth from a ""sell"" rating to a ""hold"" rating in a research note on Friday, March 5th.

Truist Securities began coverage on shares of AdaptHealth in a research note on Wednesday, March 24th. They set a ""buy"" rating and a $48.00 price objective for the company

4/12 - Baird ups the PT from $47 to $49; keeps ""Outperform"" rating

4/14 - (post news) ironically Baird downgrades SP to $35 and rating to ""Neutral""

4/14 - (post news) Truist downgrades SP from $48 to $40; keeps ""Buy""

**eighths** \- last let's look at options dynamic from 4/12 thru 4/16for 21MAY exp  (AHCO options trade on monthly; note how calls OI increases on the 30-35 strikes compared to the puts side; i will continue posting/updating thru next week if this gains any interest)

In ""silly drop/pop opps"" i would not mind going in heavy w shares to reduce risk exposure but in this case I really didn't have meaningful amount of available funds to get into position w shares so i went all-in w all available cash at at the time accumulating shares over couple of days post news...

Some Cons (imo) regarding option route:

As you can see strikes are in $5 increments and Volume and OI (but especially Volume) currently both are relatively low ....

**Last but not least positions:** Top (taxable trading account) // bottom (401K trading account)

**TLDR:** i think this 20% on news that Co-CEO is currently formerly charged w tax fraud in Denmark on personal matter dating back to 2014/2015 is considerable over-reaction and does/will not have significant mid/long term effect on core business; i am very bullish on ER relying on info provided in last ER (increased guidance; continued  stay-at-home demand; realizing synergies from recent accretive acquisitions  etc); considering my positions i am looking for the market to realize it over-corrected on the news; the discount and deal seekers to step in and for SP to start recovering toward next ER (5/6 BMO) provided broad market doesn't take a huge dump w/in next few weeks and macros co-operate....

Ideas and views presented in this DD while based on objective data (if such ""label"" can be applied to any information considering the curious nature of reality) are highly subjective and moreover are  compiled by someone who is not, even remotely, qualifies to be a financial advisor....

So let me know what ya'll guys think about this here thang....

If your curious why these trends appear common for any ticker, it is because options are priced based on quantitative models (Black-Scholes, Bi-nomial...). The market-makers will price options based on based on well-understood underlying assumptions. 

Curves of VXX with strike are inversed relative to SPY and QQQ, which I find interesting. This would probably mean the longer time goes on, the higher the expectation volatility comes back up. The higher relative cost of for OTM strikes would indicate that when VIX does eventually spike again, people are betting it will spike quite high, and you pay a premium this insurance. 

With skyrocketing IV, sometimes things get out-of-wack. Meme stocks like GME and AMC have way overpriced OTM calls for example

1618795473.0,100,DD: Boomer Edition - CSX earnings this week,"For this week's Boomer Dick and Dividends we look once again at 🚂🚂Choo Choo!  No one knows what the fuck is going on with CLOV hard to tell with that ticker if they are selling healthcare or some other clever name for weed stonks anyway.  RIDE bombed out of their Desert race so EVs that aren't Tesla are going to remain fucked because it seems like new millennial mechanics can't figure out how to actually use a DC motor after hyping it for over a decade. (Hint: Plug in motor = ⏩⏩) 

CSX is set for earnings this week and they will almost certainly beat expectations.

Why?  Well there is a handy tool to track rail traffic for CSX available on their own site to track performance metrics which includes the number of rail cars online at any given time.

https://www.csx.com/index.cfm/customers/performance-measures/

If you download the data it shows that the number of cars online hasn't been this high since 2018 (so not just beating out the pandemic numbers but smashing 2019 as well).  Previous years had much higher numbers but CSX did major efficiency cuts in 2017 that removed thousands of employees and areas that weren't running well.  (You can also see in the data velocity in 2017 was 14.7mph and is now 20mph).  

The short of it is that rail traffic appears to be up about 17% (technically it is 17% more cars online at a given time) while earnings estimates are pegging it at a 7% increase.

(Example of earning estimate stating this just recently https://finance.yahoo.com/news/csx-report-q1-earnings-low-155803201.html)

On top of that the the rail cost index was near an all time high in Q1 (https://www.aar.org/rail-cost-indexes/) which means that prices on rail freight were UP UP UP.  So they are moving more 🚂and charging 💵💰.  If you looks at earnings estimates regardless of the firm everyone seems to be pegging them at a slight increase from 2020 when the 17% increase was a sharp and almost immediate change on the year.  

If you need further confirmation from a non-CSX source the AAR also confirms that traffic is back to prepandemic levels of you remove the february blip from the Texas freeze.  CSX doesn't operate any lines in Texas so it is reasonable to assume that they weren't majorly impacted as their own data displays. https://www.aar.org/data-center/rail-traffic-data/

To top it off there is not a single part of the transportation industry that isn't struggling to meet demand right now.  CSX isn't going to be a magical exception and just have small growth when they have major lines throughout the major manufacturing centers of the Eastern US.  You can bet that they are doing it with less employees due to across the board labor shortages (listed as a concern in their annual report) and with an increasingly energy efficient line of 🚂 since they have been investing in and showing upgrades for years.

Pros: 

CSX is a profit heavy industry with government support that consistently out paces SPY as a long term investment even if you ignore the 1% per year dividend.

CSX is going to beat earnings because earnings were assuming moderate recovery vs the explosive recovery we got.  Almost no reason to doubt this and no reason to doubt they continue to do well throughout the year because as you can see in sky rocketing commodities pricing we simply cannot meat the demand for materials right now.  🚂 Are much 💪 vs tiny 🚛 when it comes to moving things like wood, steel and copper across the nation to be processed.

CSX didn't get hit by the Texas shutdown as they are an east coast outlet.  This means they will look better than several competitors with lines closer to or inside of Texas

CSX like all the major railroads prints money with a 27%ish profit margin year to year.  Railroads are a lifeblood to American supply lines that tend to do alright even in bad years.  Government support and regulations keep the industry wide stability and growth in place with more and more companies realizing that rail is the ideal way to move bulk goods when you have smart systems to plan around the delivery dates.  As long as Tony Musk and Tim 🍏 don't start shooting our goods down 🧲 tubes soon railroads are going to be good for a while.  

Cons: Good earnings reports don't always mean good stock prices 😕🙃.  Lots of unexpected things can come up and sometimes the stock gets bought up leading to the report and then dumped.  (Stonks did not like the last report but it also wasn't really that good).  $CSX did show very strong and steady growth after the last report so the real question is if there is a drop off on the report or not.  I lean towards no dip but it would suck to buy now and miss the dip since the last one was $10 drop 😕🚂💥.  

Time based Efficiency metrics are down a bit for Q1.  Trains are slightly slower and dwell times at stations are slightly longer.  Mostly labor based but it's still an issue for the slowest form of transit to move slower (note that vs 4 years ago they are 30%+ better).

Boomer Points:. 
🚂 Are an amazing and under appreciated form of transportation.  They are incredibly 👕 so the Democrats currently in power love them and they are big tough machines so Republicans tend to love them too!  It's vastly agreed upon that is long as you are a properly 💉 citizen that you will almost certainly love 🚂 and the way they follow simple patterns too!  💉💉💉💉⬆️🆙⏫=🚂🚂🚂🚂⏫🆙⬆️

Dividends: Essentially comes out to about 1% of the stock price per year if you hold it that long.  More or less free growth on something already beating SPY YOY.

Positions: I don't have any 😕.  Just saw this coming weeks earning notice has CSX.  Looked and saw it didn't appear to have a pre-earnings spike and decided that the rail data should probably show increased traffic since my companies rail cars keep getting stuck in station traffic.  The data shows a 17% increase in traffic and now I wish I had $CSX but I can't buy it til tomorrow.

Recommendations: Worst case scenario is probably that earnings randomly tank it for no good reason.  Last time it took a month to recover on bad earnings so if you aren't going to do shares then buy a call that ends a month from now.  No puts.  🚂💥🌈🐻"

From TuSimple's [S1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1823593/000119312521091150/d909743ds1.htm):

> Hallmarks of our proprietary semi-truck specific technology include our 1,000 meter perception range, 35 second planning horizon, high definition (“HD”) maps with accuracy within five centimeters, and an integrated L4 autonomous semi-truck design comprising of a fully redundant sensor suite and components.

In the world of autonomous driving, L4 is the point of full automation and a human isn't needed in the vehicle at all. And technology with a 1,000 meter range doesn't exist (the 35 second ""planning horizon"" is a direct result of the range - it's the amount of time to react at highway speeds).

This article [discusses TuSimple's gear setup](https://www.laserfocusworld.com/test-measurement/article/14197547/autonomous-vehicle-technology-shifts-to-a-more-realistic-gear):

> TuSimple equips its trucks with 10 high-definition cameras that can identify vehicles up to 1000 m away (day or night, rain or shine), giving them plenty of room to steer around other vehicles or stop when needed (see Fig. 1). Five microwave radars can detect and identify objects up to 300 m away, important if fog or rain impairs vision. A pair of lidars with 200 m range give detailed views of objects inside that range.

Let's go over that again:

 * LiDAR range - 200 meters

 * Microwave radar range - 300 meters

 * **Magical HD cameras that claim to be able to identify vehicles 1,000 meters away - are you fucking kidding me?** I can't link to YouTube, but find the video ""TuSimple's Delivers Enhanced Night Vision Capabilities with New Camera System"" and you'll see that TuSimple's supposed ""improved"" camera is actually less clear, it's just better with headlight glare, and sure as fuck doesn't have a 1,000 meter range

They claim their technology can see [up to 1,000 meters away - triple the range of any competitor](https://www.tusimple.com/technology/), but they outsource all of their hardware and nothing on the market comes close to 1,000 meters. 

> Aeva Inc, a firm founded by former Apple Inc engineers to supply a key self-driving car sensor, said on Tuesday it had reached a deal to [supply the sensors for self-driving heavy duty trucks being developed by TuSimple](https://www.reuters.com/article/aeva-tusimple-idUKL1N2K102G)

Oh, and when TuSimple [tried to demonstrate how awesome its autonomous driving system is, it failed](https://www.wired.com/story/tusimple-self-driving-truck-cameras-computer-vision/):

> The demo drive also, however, makes clear there’s work to be done. After 40 minutes of, uneventful robo-driving, a computer voice interrupts our conversation: “Autonomous driving off.” Without my noticing it, the safety driver has retaken control. “I’ve got a freeze on my visual,” he tells Hou. “I shut it down for safety.” A network card in that server box next to me disconnected, likely due to the truck's vibration, freezing the system's human-machine interface and blocking the bit that does the motion planning from the bit that executes its commands.

> And so this flesh-and-bones human holds the wheel and works the pedals for the next 20 minutes, taking us off the highway and back to TuSimple’s garage. 

TuSimple hasn't sold any of their technology. [Their revenues are from traditional trucking](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tusimple-ipo-filing-shows-self-driving-trucks-still-a-money-loser-11616535572?mod=searchresults_pos4&page=1):

> TuSimple has so far earned money as a traditional freight-hauler, not from selling its self-driving technology ready in 2024. It has customer reservations for more than 5,700 trucks, although those aren’t equivalent to sales revenue.

**TL;DR - $TSP claims to have self-driving technology that has three times the range of anything on the market, but haven't demonstrated it, or sold it, and the equipment they currently use is from other manufacturers. They have 70 trucks (50 in the U.S., 20 in Europe and Asia) on the road making normal freight deliveries, with ""safety drivers"" in the vehicles, and that's where their revenues are generated.**"

# Introduction

Hey, it's your girl Dry-Drink. Was a WSBs lurker for years, used to be that this site was about smart but risky DDs, and ballsy bets with good potential. Who can forget the legendary thesmd AMD updates from 2019? But now it seems we pride ourselves on being retards who lose money for a living with options we don't understand. What happened to us? Here's to bringing back some old-school circa 2017 WSBs.

I've [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ibhpo2/psa_leverage_margin_and_proper_diversification/) a few [times](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kspobo/true_wsb_leveraged_portfolio_continues_to_deliver/) about this [portfolio](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mt0ec3/wsb_leveraged_smartbeta_update_now_up_350k_108/) and strategy. I've gotten a lot of questions as to how it works and how to implement it so I've put together my definitive guide on this. From here on out, I'll just post updates of the portfolio performance periodically. I don't have a TLDR, unfortunately if you're interested in implementing this, you will have to read through this short guide. It's not super complicated once you get it, I promise.

# Glossary

Compensated vs Uncompensated Risk: The market rewards you for some risks, specifically the ones that cannot be diversified away (like overall market risk, or the risk of value companies). The market does not reward you with a return for taking on risks that can be diversified away. In other words, no one is paying you money for betting the farm on one stock.

[Kelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion) Criterion: The percent of your account to invest in a risky asset to have maximum compound returns. For stocks, the Kelly Criterion is given by the formula [Sharpe/Volatility](https://www.cashchronicles.com/2019/05/20/the-kelly-investment-criteria-and-optimal-leverage/). So for stocks, maximum compound return (Kelly bet) is around 0.4/20% = **200%** (that is, you borrow as much money as you have, to buy twice as much in stocks as you otherwise could, by using leverage).

Margin Call: When your account equity is too low versus the stocks you hold, your broker can force you to sell stocks with a margin call. In other words, if your leverage is too high, the broker will de-leverage you automatically.

Portfolio Margin (PM): A margin account that determines margin maintenance with risk models instead of set leverage targets. It will typically allow greater leverage (**not that you should use more leverage than I say later)** and, most importantly, will let you [sell SPX boxes](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fehabt/box_spread_financing_for_extremely_cheap_085/) for cheap borrowing with no effect on the margin maintenance.

Smart-beta: Catch-all term for equity indices or ETFs that are not market-cap weighted, but actually tilt towards additional sources of stock compensated risks (value, momentum and quality being the big three). Because these added risk sources are uncorrelated with the market, they lead to portfolios with higher returns and lower risk

# Background

For maximum compound growth, you want two things: Only take risk that compensate you, and take as much as it is optimal for max returns (Kelly bet size). In this post, I am going to show you the portfolio that has the theoretically highest compound return. History confirms this portfolio works, but don't invest in this because it worked well in the past or my updates. That the theory is well-supported in historical returns and practice is just the cherry on top.

Big-picture, the portfolio can be set up as follows:

1. Buy a globally-diversified portfolio of smart-beta ETFs (a lot of value, quality and momentum firms). You want country, currency and sector diversification to make sure you diversify away as much of the risk you don't get paid for and only take on compensated, equity risk. Using smart-beta further increases returns.
2. Leverage the portfolio to the optimal, mathematical number that produces highest returns (about 2:1 leverage). That is, borrow on margin to borrow twice as many shares as you otherwise could.
3. \- Bonus) [Sell SPX boxes](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fehabt/box_spread_financing_for_extremely_cheap_085/) to get dirt-cheap financing rates for your leverage (\~0.5% borrowing rate, instead of Interactive Brokers 1.6% margin rate). This is not required, the most important part is the actual portfolio and level of leverage (steps 1 and 2). This is just a cheaper way to borrow.

**Note:** This is NOT riskless. On the contrary, this is a high-risk strategy, with plenty of financial risk. You can lose money and A LOT of money in the short/medium and, heck, even long-term. It would've lost about 83% during 2008 GFC, even more during the Great Depression. But eventually, it has and should come out ahead. All I'm saying is that it is the highest amount of risk that you would rationally take with a portfolio and hence, will have the highest average, expected, compound return. Taking any less risk (less leverage) should result in lower compound returns, that's logical. And taking any more risk (more leverage) also leads to lower compound returns (that's what the Kelly Criterion proves).

# Benefits

1. No position on volatility or downside protection (aka ""theta gang immune"").
2. Only takes on compensated risk. Better global diversification and access to smart-beta products than you otherwise could with options and futures.
3. Extremely tax efficient. It borrows as cheaply as you could with options and futures, but gains all stay unrealized.
4. Much more protected from short-term movements (you don't lose 30% just because your favorite stock missed earnings).

# Audience

The portfolio has the highest expected compound growth from index investing and requires little active management (no individual stocks or trying to time a trend). **Hence, it is ideal as a base WSB portfolio.** If you believe you can consistently trade for a living, that's great! You should probably ignore this post. But if you've lost enough money to feel like the market is a casino, here's a portfolio where you can let your money simmer and earn high returns before you decide on your next YOLO. I personally only use this; every time I have more money to invest, I just direct it into this portfolio.

# My Portfolio

I opened a Portfolio margin account at Interactive Brokers. You need >$100K for this (see below for smaller-account alternatives) I use a 60% USA, 25% Developed Market, 15% Emerging market split, all with low-cost, smart-beta stock ETFs. I've posted my portfolio on each of my updates but here it is once more. Again, just a bunch of stock ETFs that use smart-beta methodology, have low costs, and diversify globally. Feel free to use the same ones. I especially like Vanguard Multifactor fund (VFMF), the Schwab Fundamental funds (like FNDC) and the iShares multifactor funds (like EMGF). If you want something simple, a portfolio like:

30% VFMF

30% VTI

15% FNDF

10% ISCF

7% FNDE

8% EMGF

Is very close to what I use. Or feel free to copy my exact weights below. You'll see different positions because I tax-loss harvested back in March 2020.

[Current Portfolio](https://preview.redd.it/rb14mo0640u61.png?width=2952&format=png&auto=webp&s=a242fe349528291cc664942edcacba378ef011f8)

So far, I am up \~108% annualized since June 2020 but, again, do NOT do this just because it worked well in the past. Do it because you understand and agree with the theory. I plan to do this for decades. I recommend you use Interactive Brokers due to their low margin rates. Although if you'll sell SPX boxes to avoid the margin rates, you could do it anywhere that offers portfolio margin (ex: TDA).

# Managing the Portfolio

You opened a Portfolio Margin account, bought twice as much in stocks as you had money for (using your ideal ETFs in the weights shown above, or the ones I use) and even sold SPX boxes to get rid of your negative cash balance to borrow cheaply. What to do now?

As the market rises, your equity will grow and your leverage (as a percent of the account) will drop. So it is vital you re-leverage further (borrow more against your bigger account) and buy more stocks to get back up to 2:1 leverage. If markets drop in value, you'll do the opposite: control your risk by selling some positions, paying off some of the debt, and bringing leverage back down. This is KEY towards avoiding actual deep, nearly-100% losses and to obtain the highest compound return. Just like boomers rebalance their 50/50 stock/bond Vanguard portfolios back to 50/50 if it gets out of line, so should you keep your portfolio at roughly 2:1 leverage. And no, it's not ""buying high, selling low"". You can't time the markets, so just stay disciplined and rebalance. This portfolio has the highest compound return **despite** having to sell somewhat during down markets. To minimize transaction costs and the cost of weekly whipsaws, I recommend you sell and decrease leverage if your leverage is higher than 2.2x, and buy more stocks by borrowing/re-leveraging back up if your leverage is lower than 1.8x. These are the **rebalancing bands**.

When you sell positions to deleverage, you would want to either keep the additional cash as collateral until the next SPX box expires, or just buy back a box. I recommend selling boxes in the near future (3-12 months) so you're always decently close to an expiring box, or a box so close to expiry that buying it back would entail very low spreads. BTW, when a box expires, you don't have to do anything. It is cash-settled automatically.

If you ever add money into this account, just invest it in such a way to get close to that 2:1 leverage. So if leverage was less than 2:1, you'd buy stocks with your added cash+more borrowing, if leverage was higher maybe you just keep it in cash/ST bond fund like ICSH/buy back a box spread. Play it by ear in your specific circumstance, just make sure your leverage stays within the rebalancing bands.

# Timing the Market

It is reasonable to let leverage rise a bit past 2.2x if markets are quite cheap because they've dropped in value (like in March 2020). It also is reasonable to let leverage drift down if markets are at ATHs (see my current portfolio is only about 1.75:1 leverage right now). The Kelly Criterion is clear that you'd want to leverage past 2:1 if the equity risk premium is abnormally high and vice-versa, so it makes sense. Don't do A LOT of that but a little bit of opportunistic market-timing (I call it ""delayed rebalancing"" when stocks are either real cheap or real expensive) is likely warranted.

# Looking Forward

No, you're not late to the party. Obviously, it would've been better to start a portfolio like this back in June 2020 when I first posted about it but hindsight is 20/20. This strategy does not require timing the markets; today is still a good time to start. Even today, stocks are decently priced, especially if using smart-beta. I expect this leveraged portfolio to have a return going forward of about 13% average annualized. Obviously, what you'll actually get short-term might be much more or much less but if you diligently stick to it, that would be the average return I expect. This is about three times as high as I expect for the very-expensive S&P500 (because of the 2:1 leverage, the international exposure and the smart beta vs the S&P 500 at a nosebleed valuation level of 37 Shiller CAPE 10).

# FAQs

\- Account minimum to start?

Ideally, you start with $100K (somewhat more is preferable to give you a cushion over the $100K barrier) and a portfolio margin account. Otherwise, you can just use regular margin and pay the slightly higher borrowing cost. I probably wouldn't bother if I had less than $20K, but if you have $50K or more, I'd say go for it.

\- What if I get margin called?

If you follow the strategy as you should (selling positions if losses mount, to pay back the debt and keep the leverage around 2:1) then you should never actually get to a position where your leverage is so high, your broker is liquidating you themselves. So you should never get an actual margin call.

\- What about using Leveraged ETFs (ex: SPUU)?

Those have high management fees, sometimes have too much leverage (ex: UPRO), will not let you diversify globally as effectively, there are no smart-beta options and they rebalance daily (instead of using the 1.8-2.2 leverage bands I recommend). IMO, it's better to rebalance a little less frequently than daily (this is what using bands accomplishes).

\- Where can I learn more about this? How did YOU learn it?

Unfortunately, I don't actually have a good resource for you. I've learned a lot about smart-beta, leverage, the Kelly Criterion and these topics to know what I'm doing here but it has been from a bunch of different sources. I hope this is enough to get you started though.

\- Why not more leverage for more returns?

Don't leverage more than this. Leveraging further leads to **overbetting (a condition where you're past the Kelly Criterion).** Any more leverage than that, and your portfolio risk goes up and your return goes down. Don't be a Bill Hwang and blow up with margin calls. Be disciplined, rebalance, keep leverage around 2:1, and let the portfolio do its magic.

\- Doesn't this only work during Bull markets?

This is the opposite of the above FAQ since it implies I'm using too much leverage. This is the theoretically highest compound returning portfolio **given** the risk of stocks (i.e. including both bear and bull markets). Obviously, in bull markets, it will perform amazingly (like now). And portfolios with even more leverage will be even better. During Bear markets, it will perform worse than not using leverage (and portfolios with more leverage will do far worse). Since I can't time the market or know when good or bad periods will come, I just use the optimal leverage a long-term portfolio would need for max returns. That's 2:1.

\- This sounds like the famous Hedgefundie UPRO/TMF portfolio no?

I personally think that portfolio has multiple problems (the LETFs themselves, the risk parity weights do not lead to max sharpe, even if it were max sharpe, I'm aiming for max compound growth not max Sharpe, and the leverage of 3x is just about past the Kelly Criterion). [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mk71rt/wsb_leveraged_smartbeta_still_going_bonkers_up/gtwe5p4/?context=3) a chain of comments where I dig into the math I used to come to these personal conclusions.

\- Doesn't this lose money during Bear markets? If you use 2:1 leverage, shouldn't it have been wiped out during the GFC (stocks dropped more than 50% then)?

It loses a ton of money during Bear markets (about 65% personally this past March, much more in historical backtests that include events like the Great Depression). I didn't say it was riskless, only that it had the highest compound return long-term than any other strategy that invests more or less in stocks. The reason it doesn't get fully wiped out is precisely because you sell positions every time your leverage rises past 2.2x, to get leverage back in line. This is crucial. Otherwise, a simple market drop of 50% over any amount of time will fully liquidate you (compound return of -100%, the exact opposite of what we're aiming for).

\- Can I do better if I add non-stock assets, or use dma200, or etc?

Probably, but not by much. The main issue is that assets like commodities and bonds are so tax inefficient and I don't estimate high-enough returns for them to warrant them. That said, if you're optimistic-enough about them, add them, recalculate your Kelly Criterion, and leverage accordingly. Ditto for any other strategy like dma200; if I felt confident about them, I would add them so if you do, then add them, that's totally fine!

\- Why do you only show returns since June?

Been doing this for a few years but only have computed data from Interactive Brokers since June. Before that, I used other brokers and it would be a pain to try to compute my personal overall returns. If you don't believe I got through Dec 2018 or March 2020, then I can't really do much for you. [Here's a backtest](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=2&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=5&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=true&portfolioName1=2%3A1+Leveraged+S%26P+500&portfolioName2=S%26P+500&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=VFINX&allocation1_1=200&allocation1_2=100&symbol2=CASHX&allocation2_1=-100) since 1985 showing it wouldn't have blown up, even during 2008, (though the drawdowns can be deep, again, there's risk!) and does outperform eventually as theory would say. 

\- Well, I invested in X stock and got much higher returns!

Good for you (srs)! If I knew what stocks to pick to make a lot of money, I would just do that. But I have no clue, so I'm just investing in a few sources of high risk/returns, diversify away all risk I don't get paid for and leverage to the maximum compound return.

\- This doesn't belong in WSBs, why are you posting it?

I thought a 2:1 smart-beta leveraged stock portfolio, funded with SPX boxes, would be the kind of portfolio WSBs would appreciate. If it's boring, I get it, I'll just post gain/loss porn from here on out any ways.

1618778361.0,1901,CLOV DD - No Bullshit,"CLOV has a very interesting setup right now but way too many people seem to only care about the short float debate that has been unfolding over the last few days. To sum that up: FactSet (top financial data provider) had the CLOV float listed as 23.5M and short interest at 39M - putting the percentage of the float shorted at 146.6%. This circulated online and has been argued on twitter and reddit starting Friday. Factset has since updated the float to 109.8M making the 39M short interest account for 36% of the float. They previously had deducted the CEO’s class B shares from the total class A shares, and although his shares are “non-tradeable” and shouldn't be included in the public float, they were only using the class A shares to determine the float as all class B shares are already non-tradeable unless converted - so shouldn’t have been part of the equation to begin with. Now I could get more into the ""Hindenberg said this” and “S3 said this” bullshit that people have been arguing about...

But heres why NONE OF THAT EVEN FUCKING MATTERS

Shorts and those who have been bashing CLOV and arguing against the original short float number are taking a victory lap, like Factset updating the short float to 36% destroys the entire bullish case for CLOV and now it will tank. BULLSHIT, here’s why:

The 39M short interest number being used in the short float calculation is from 3/31. Over two weeks ago. When the two highest volume and highest short volume days in CLOV history have occurred within the last two weeks. With \~30M short volume on 4/8 and \~90M short volume on Friday (according to Fintel). We don’t know at this time how much of the short volume is covered and would be included in the current short interest; but given all this, you could logically conclude the short float on CLOV right now could be pretty damn high. For context, 36% short float - based on outdated short interest from 3/31 - is in the ballpark of double what we're currently seeing in GME or AMC, and would still make CLOV one of the highest short float stocks in the entire market right now.

https://preview.redd.it/rvr4bslwszt61.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=801f7c4f339e3573272d280586c7a9bd54d8343d

The short float is only a small piece of the puzzle, and it’s without a doubt high enough to trigger a short squeeze if price continues to rise, end of story. Now let’s get into the shit that really matters.

First off, from a technical perspective, there are some good signs. (if you hate technical analysis or think you're so good at it that you'll find a way to disagree with whatever I say then skip to the next section)

https://preview.redd.it/06weuky6tzt61.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=64b8a0b9d28d85d079627746c4e1832aec8f153e

* MACD bullish
* RSI only starting to warm up
* Decent support built between $7-$7.30
* But what’s really screaming on this chart are these two recent MASSIVE buying volume days coming after about a month of consolidation with a double bottom pattern making higher lows.

**Now let’s get into call volume**

[Some of the order that came through Friday](https://preview.redd.it/ksveumt0tzt61.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=2577d77bf9ab0d6f3180c955e9af5b861f859f3b)

https://preview.redd.it/a7e1pes3tzt61.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=83c9ea5a0d92808cfd65626f792fa1078443b1ed

Fridays call flow and the sheer volume and open interest on some of these call options speak for themselves. This is where I should break down the mechanics of a gamma squeeze, but really all you need to know is that heavy call volume is important for two reasons: 1) it can be a good indicator of where money is flowing in the market and 2) the people who write the call options need to buy shares to hedge against their position. The more the price rises the more shares they need to buy, helping to push price higher just like we see in a short squeeze.

&#x200B;

Next, CLOV is down over 50% from Dec/Jan highs. Some of the main reasons for the drop would be:

* Money flowing out of growth stocks and SPACS
* Hindenberg short report
* Short seller price manipulation

The Hindenburg short attack really did a number on CLOV. The stock was trading at about $14 prior to the release of their short report and dropped over 50% in the weeks following its release.

Hindenburg attacked CLOV from many different angles. One of their main arguments being that Clover Health uses misleading and unethical marketing practices to boost sales, as evidence stating that in 2016: “Clover was fined for misleading marketing practices by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)”

Well, just this month (April 8th), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services granted Clover heath approval in 10 new states. CLOV has yet to release a PR on this but it has been updated on the CMS website (see picture below). The stock price jumped with huge volume on this news but short sellers were able to manipulate it back down until the spike we just saw on Friday.

https://preview.redd.it/sc2w81eatzt61.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=7eb791918794ff6a425e42fffa397e409788b782

It seems that Hindenbergs argument doesn’t hold up as the same federal agency (CMS) they were using to support claims against Clover Health is currently supporting Clovers expansion into 10 new states. Which is huge news for CLOV by the way.

&#x200B;

**Wrapping this up**

Now say what you will about Chamath, but he had retail investors back during the GME squeeze. He promoted it, posted his personal positions, and while Wall Street, CNBC, and others attacked Gamestop, Chamath defended retail traders and the movement as a whole. It may be a total coincidence that his SPAC’s were the target of short attacks shortly after, but his support of the GME squeeze may have made him a bigger target.

&#x200B;

No one knows what will happen in the market, I sure as hell don’t, but given all that's been laid out here, I like the stock.

$CLOV to $100

&#x200B;

EDIT: anyone who thinks this is part of a conspiracy to distract from GME, it's not. Holding GME, love the setup going into this week.

Also: this is not financial advice, do your own DD blah blah blah

And for those asking about my position. I'm looking to add shares and calls Monday and/or throughout the week based on the price action and within my own personal risk tolerance.

&#x200B;

**Update 4/20:** people asking if they should sell. You shouldn't be trading if you need someone to tell you.

Nothing has changed. The market dumped and people sold. If there's not enough buying pressure selling can take over. Doesn't mean buyers won't take back control.

Long term, my opinion is that anything under $15 is a buy. Dips are opportunities. Not worried.

I like the stock. Make your own decision."

1618773516.0,175,Why meta analyses of financial forecasts are not binary: Bayesian Statistics," Took a lot of adderall and read the jim cramer post as soon as it started to hit. Just wasted a few hours of my day writing this. I have shit to do

**Why meta analyses of financial forecasts are not binary:**

A famous argument for why Financial Analysts/Traders/Stock pushers are frauds or don’t know what they are doing is that they are barely correct out perform a coin flip in terms of the ratio of correct predictions on total predictions. While I do (most of the time) stand in the same camp of believing most analysts/stock pushers are frauds/don’t know what they are doing(at least the ones who have public followings), I don’t think this is a fair calculus or argument. I will explain why. 

**Binariness:**

First off we need to define what I mean when I say Binariness. In this scenario, meta analyses will determine a prediction by being Right or Wrong by some determining metric. This metric most of the time will have some sort of dependency on time and a uniform timeframe for all the predictions(*i.e given a prediction date t1, did the the prediction come true by t2➝t1+3months?*). Being fair, they will take this statistical flaw into account and take and compare different t2 values( *t2➝t1+3weeks,  t2➝t1+6months,  t2➝t1+next quarter, etc)* but I want to exclaim that the issue is that the predictions are NOT analyzed independently, when they should/need to be. 

**Why were they wrong?:**

So first off I want to clarify that predictionsCorrect/predictionsTotal is the correct calculus, but the way we quantify each variable is wrong. This section will clarify the steps need to quantify WRONG predictions CORRECTLY. Let’s assume an analyst deemed a prediction wrong, lets analyze their decision. 

**Direct contradiction of the prediction:**

Let’s say(lots of assumptions but it is important to get the point across) that we have a    

prediction that says “Stock x will go from $15 to  $30 by next year because of good 

earnings. ” and by t2 stock x is $21. The stock price obviously did not meet the price prediction but why not? Did x have good earnings? Did they have bad earnings? In both of these specific scenarios, the predictor SHOULD be wrong. They might have been right about having good earnings but they were not right with the price prediction(so only ½ legs were met). If they had bad earnings then this was a direct contradiction of the prediction(0/2 legs were met). 

**Missing leg of thesis:**

Elaborating on the above example’s outcome where ½ legs were met, it is important to   
 ask why this leg was missing? Did the predictor take this leg into account and disregard   
 it? Did they just not think of it? Either way, it is important for any predictor to think of all 

variables, outcomes, and sensitivities that their thesis can be impacted by. In either of 

these cases, the predictor deserves to be wrong. 

**Black Swan Event:**

But what happens if an event happens that NOBODY could have predicted given the 

available data? Now defining something to be a black swan event can be pretty subjective 

at times. For example, a TSLA bear might not define the event when Elon Musk broke the Cyber Trucks window causing the stock price to fall as a Black Swan Event because they probably hold the thesis that their cars are shit and that their prices targets priced this in. A TSLA bull would probably defend themselves by saying that this WAS a black swan event. I’m not going to go into detail on whether these arguments are valid or not but I want to bring light to the option of throwing the data out since it is inconclusive. 

**Thesis has not been satisfied:**

Now lets say an analyst is doing a meta analysis on another analysts predictions and like I said before, they take all their predictions and compare them for some constant t2 without respect to the predictions actual thesis. What happens if the the prediction has an underlying assumption that is either WAY before t2 or WAY after t2? Now the prediction will appear wrong(or right) but the underlying test is flawed, skewing the score. If the predictor says “Stock x will go from $15 to $30 by t2” but the analyst is comparing this outcome to t3 where t3 != t2, now you have a bad metric. 

**Devils advocate: Why were they right?**

I don’t think I need to elaborate this side of the coin as they are  mirrors of the above but 

obviously we need to cover all bases and want to make that explicit. 

**Bayesian Statistics:**

This whole essay is swimming around the idea of Bayesian Statistics, or Bayes Theorem of conditional probability: 

P(A|B) =P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)

This says the probability of event A GIVEN that event B is true is equal to **(**the probability of event B GIVEN that event A is true**)\*(**the probability of event A happening**)** all divided by **(**the probability of event B happening**).** Now, I won’t continue with the maths but I want to get across that this is the framework that should be used when quantifying a correctness metric. A metric that scores an outcome with respect to its thesis happening. After basing each right or wrong on its underlying factor, you will receive a bayesian approached ratio of totalCorrect/totalPredictions. 

**Conclusion:**

Hopefully this made sense and hopefully you learned something. I’m not going to proof read this either because I need to go to the gym and finish my day. I got caught in writing this because I took a bunch of adderall and didn’t see where the time went. Fuck

**TL:DR**

Don’t trust all articles that say “\[Your fav analyst\] is only right 50% of the time!”. Many people who try to discredit an analysts outcomes are not using the correct metric in order to determine correctness."
1618766856.0,282,PSFE DD,"Paysafe is a new entrant to the fintech field. They went public via spac titled ' **Foley Trasimene Acquisition II Corp** '. And just like every other SPAC in the last 6 months, the stock price has run up then gotten crushed. I personally hate spacs, however if the underlying company is valuable once the merger is complete they can be a good investment.

 The Spac is sponsored by Bill Foley, a notable entertainment investor. He made a fortune investing in wineries, golf courses, sports franchises, and hotels. Their CEO is Phil Mchugh, who has a track record working at citibank and barclays. Overall the management team seems pretty impressive. (Especially considering citi handles all wire transfers on earth. The CEO has a lot of experience with credit and merchant payments. I did notice that his linkdin profile is written in the third person, which could be a red flag. 

Paysafe is fundamentally a transaction handler. They serve mostly medium and smaller merchants, and transfer money between merchants, currencies, and forms of credit. They have some larger customers, notably including fortnite, twitch, and spotify. The firm handled 92 billion $ of transactions in 2020. They focus much of their business on gaming, and gambling. Which are both attractive and growing markets. 

Taking a look at the companies SEC filings, the notable risk factors they list include risk due to brexit, risk of accidentally processing fraudulent claims, and heavy reliance on third parties for much of their processes (payment processing, banking, routing/connectivity, customer support, IT). This leaves me with the question what do they really do? My understanding is that the company provides value to customers by the middleman and acting as a connection between merchants, local banks, and larger financial institutions. They process payments and take a processing fee. 

Other notable risks would be the major competitors that the company faces in the fintech world. They are partnered with visa and mastercard, but will have to compete with COIN, SQ, SOFI and many others. 

Advantages? The firm has a solid hold in the European and international markets. It's in a quickly growing industry, and has good leadership. 

&#x200B;

Finances.

PSFE has a market cap of $9.7 Billion. Their trailing 12 months revenue is $1.4 billion, and their gross profit was $891 million or 62.5%, very nice. 

The market cap/gross profit ratio is 9.7bil/891mil=10.8. At this ratio the company is pretty attractively priced. (If you bought the entire company, you'd make 100% profit in 10.8 years assuming no change in valuation). For reference, this ratio on a few other firms.

PLTR-68

COST-6.3

AAPL-19.1

MCD- 17.1

INTC-6.03

SPOT-27

SQ-42.6

PYPL-31.6

VISA-28.8

Relatively speaking, the price/earnings on this company is a bit low. Especially compared to their most similar competitors PYPL and SQ. 

Taking a look at the balance sheet it isn't so sexy, they have a lot of liabilities and long term debt. Not the worst I've seen, they still have more assets. Their quick ratio is 1.35. Perhaps this explains the low P/E. 

&#x200B;

Overall, the company has stiff competition, but good leadership and valuable customers. They are also specializing in a very attractive market. The company is very undervalued in my opinion, and could potentially have a significant run up to reach a more reasonable multiplier. If it's multiplier were to be similar to its peers (SQ,PYPL), the company would 3x in valuation. 

I started off this DD hating this company because it was a SPAC, however after looking into it I think I may invest.

Edit: another notable risk I just at thought of for these guys is currency valuations, they do a lot of transferring between currencies as they have a very large international presence. Also fixed market cap # because google is a liar

1618764327.0,56,CLF commodities supercycle possible 5x or more.,"Hello, I am a large owner of CLF  right now. 
It appears we are in a commodity supercycle replicating 2008 and 2010 cycles on this particular stock. 
Steel prices have been hitting record highs what seems to be almost every other week. Iron ore prices are also at record time highs, as well as other building materials. 

With these rapid price Increases it's extremely possible that we are currently in a supercycle. They show no immediate signs of slowing down.
I encourage you to look at June 13 2008 when the share price reached $101.58 a share. And then again in april 29 2011 when the share price reached $93.72 a share. It appears this time around supply cannot meet demand just like on these past 2 dates that were in commodities supercycles. 

Other Catalysts being China, Russia, and United states are all trying to improve their infrastructure spending which increases demand for steel. Don't miss out on the opportunity of a lifetime. Diamond hands? Why not steel hands?"
1618758206.0,7438,I analyzed all 700+ buy and sell recommendations made by Jim Cramer in 2021. Here are the results.,"**Preamble:** Jim Cramer is definitely a controversial figure. While argument can be made on whether he is on the side of retail investors or not, what I really wanted to know was how his stock picks are performing. Surprisingly, there were no trackers for the performance of Cramer’s pick in his program (his program is Mad Money, for those who are not familiar). 

**Where the data is from:** [here](https://madmoney.thestreet.com/screener/index.cfm). All the 19,201 stock picks made by Cramer are listed here. His stock picks are updated here daily. While Cramer mentions a lot of stocks in his program, I only considered the stocks that Cramer specifically recommended that you should buy or sell. (I have ignored the stocks where Cramer says he likes/dislikes the stock since I felt that it’s a vague statement and cannot be considered as a buy/sell recommendation). 

**Analysis:** There were 725 buy/sell recommendations made by Cramer in 2021. Out of this, 651 were Buy and 74 were Sell. For both sets, I calculated the stock price change across four periods. 

a. One Day

b. One Week 

c. One Month

d. Price Change till date 

I also checked what percentage of Cramer’s calls were right across different time periods. 

**Results:** 

https://preview.redd.it/v6v86fgm5yt61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=46d99ad37e0f07803910a0ee250883aee7be43ee

 Cramer made a total of 651 buy recommendations over the course of the past 4 months. If you had invested in every single stock, he recommended and then pulled out the next day, the returns were a staggering 555%. He was also right on 58.9% of the calls he made (Benchmark being 50% since anyone can pick a random stock and the probability of the stock going up is 50%). The weekly performance returns are also a respectable 42% but he was barely touching 50% in the percentage of right picks. One month from his recommendations, the stock return is an abysmal -223% and he was wrong more than he was right on his calls. The returns till date are also phenomenal with 446% return and Cramer being right a whopping 63.6% in his stock picks. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7tt84a2o5yt61.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bc245cf01922010a13705e721d564a4299ebbac

Cramer’s sell recommendations performed better than his buy recommendations across different time periods. This stat is particularly commendable since we were in a predominantly bull market across the last 4 months. 57.5% of the stocks he recommended as a sell dropped in price the next day with a cumulative return of -118.9%. This trend is observed across the time period with returns for the sell recommendations being negative. The only statistic that is working against Cramer’s sell recommendation is the percentage of right picks till date being only 42%. But still the cumulative return for all the stocks was -206%. Please note that Cramer made only 74 sell recommendations against a whopping 651 buy recommendations during the same period of time. 

**Limitations of the analysis**

The above analysis is far from perfect and has multiple limitations. First, Cramer has made a total of 19K recommendations in his program. I have only analyzed his 2021 recommendations. The site which provides the data is extremely limited in terms of how we can access the data. Also, currently the data is pulled from street.com which was earlier owned by Cramer. They update the data everyday after the show, but I could not verify if they go back and change the calls down the line (very unlikely with it being a large business). Also, for the return calculations, I have only used the closing price of the stock across the time periods. The returns can theoretically be higher if you consider the intra-day highs and lows. 

**Conclusion** 

No matter how we feel about Cramer, the one-day returns on both his buy and sell recommendations have been phenomenal. I started the analysis thinking that the returns would be mediocre at best as there were no trackers actively tracking the returns from his calls. But the data points otherwise. It seems that there is a lot of scope for short term plays based on Cramer’s recommendation. Let me know what you think!

1618715304.0,83,CBOE VIX Options: Maybe Overdo for a Sharp Move Higher,"Hey, guys. I decided to bring out the ol' Excel to get some data on the SPY over the last 12-months to measure the money flow, and I found something super interesting.

Money flow is essentially the inflow and outflow of money coming into a particular company, asset class, or security. It's a good way of measuring market participation. Higher market participation in bullish times often takes equities to new highs, but in bearish times it becomes a drag on equity prices. When money flow oscillates in tighter intervals, we tend to see more spikes in volatility rather than when it oscillates slightly or not at all.

Let us take a lot at the SPY and the charts representing it. We have the price index, the total flows, the inflow(+) and outflow (-), and the net flow charts. Taking all of this information together, you may see where I come to the conclusion of why the market is overdue for a little more volatility, which means that VIX options are in play for the next few weeks most likely.

[This is the price index of the SPY on a per day basis over a 12-month period. We have reaching higher highs in the recent weeks while volatility has been dropping. This is a classic bearish sign for the market. Not to say that we will see a correction by any means, just a little bit more volatility, I think. Like I said, high volatility in a bull market is good. In a bear market, not so much.](https://preview.redd.it/hbfiz3fwcut61.png?width=2475&format=png&auto=webp&s=4910cea6eea6159d41c54f078e49d8e623051df6)

[This  is the total flows on a per day basis over the same period of time. As you can see, volatility dropped in the most recent weeks in comparison to those before and the SPY went up. Reiterating: it's a bearish signal based on historical measurements. But expecting volatility is not the same as saying I'm a bear. I'm just seeing perhaps more swings in the weeks to come to both the downside and the upside. If we're in bullish mindset, the price will trend up. If bears take over, hold on to your hats.](https://preview.redd.it/bwqkuld1dut61.png?width=2486&format=png&auto=webp&s=a093c106910abe22916074072cb7df322f8dff17)

[This is the inflow\/outflow chart over the same period of time. Notice the higher frequency on the left-side of the chart vs the right-side. This tells me that there is higher market activity as larger volumes of inflows and outflows are happening in tighter spreads, thus giving the \\""clustered\\"" effect. As we look towards the right-side of the graph, we see a lower frequency as inflow and outflow activity isn't so active and the spreads look \\""looser.\\"" The money flow frequency can change at any moment but just be aware that the frequency starts going higher because of an event that forces it. Often that event happens after a low frequency environment. We are currently in a low frequency environment.](https://preview.redd.it/gy3vyq0idut61.png?width=2466&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbca5977189fdc9e7e6e30d1d3e55396b6a19c85)

[This graph represents the total net flows per month. The peaks \(i.e. turning points\) show where the CBOE Volatility Index \(VIX\) has stabilized. Since the last spike in the VIX around late January\/early February, we haven't seen the VIX consolidate at a bottom. The data for April is only partially available because the month isn't complete, so do not take the line upward following the last turning point as a definite sign of stabilization. However, if we can assume that the final line going upward will average the current rate of return that is already there, then we may be due for a stabilization test soon.](https://preview.redd.it/v4e4xp2ceut61.png?width=2173&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d4c0a2c3b3b7ab1c7426e42db700438c644f425)

You can see the correlations between the VIX stabilization and the net flow peaks around the period by comparing the chart above with the one below.

https://preview.redd.it/oc2wlpcbfut61.png?width=902&format=png&auto=webp&s=f599b35562d2b4494e138b98de2358ea5de66052

Based on this argument, I think we may start seeing the VIX consolidate at around this level. We're in a low frequency environment, the perfect spot for when high frequency starts to kick in. After a test of stabilization, we either see a sharp move upwards or the continuation of a slow decay before it gets retested again. Are we at a place of consolidation, or are we quickly approaching one? I don't know for certain, but I like to follow the money.

The truck's battery gave out at mile 40, at which point the driver (who is apparently a janitor or security guard at LM) veered a mile off course so they could recharge. The truck sat not moving for around two hours before taking the wrong route to get back on course and finally deciding to just turn around and drive back to the start via the highway. 

Honestly, that's not the worst part.  Lordstown posted a video to Instagram showing the truck in action during the race.  It was *ahem* ...underwhelming. My 68 year old mother would have passed them on the shoulder in her 10 year old Chevy Malibu and flipped them the bird for driving like a bitch. One of the biggest concerns many have had about this truck is that having the motors in the wheel hubs versus mounted to the body would cause serious issues on bumpy terrain and lead to the motors being rendered inoperable when you hit a pothole. The video of them driving Miss Daisy though the Baja desert did not assuage these fears for me.  Perhaps it did for others. Perhaps I'm overreacting. 

I had hoped to see them go balls to the wall.  Announce their presence with aplomb and say ""Here we are, America! Come get yours off the line in September!"" At least then if it broke down (like literally 50% of the entrants in this race), you could at least say ""Hey, we went for it.  We've got some things to work on before next year's race, but the truck is still a winner."" Instead, they drove it like a 90 year old who is driving for the first time in their life five minutes after smoking their first fatty. And they still broke down 40 miles into the 250 mile race. Really disappointing. 

So, positions. 

200 shares @ 11.95 average that I expect to lose value as I will continue to hold long term. 

15 4/23C $13
25 4/23C $12
25 4/23C $10
10 4/23P $8 

The options were stupid and overly optimistic, but I bought them as lottery tickets hoping that Lordstown would push the truck to the limits today.  They didn't. 

My only source of hope right now is that this market makes no sense.  Maybe they'll shake this off and spike Monday. Should have joined the theta gang and sold some covered calls of my shares.

Edit: more embarrassment.  The other EV in the race,  lovingly nicknamed ""the shitbox,"" which is nothing more than an old 4runner mated with a damn Nissan Leaf is still going strong and on pace to finish under the time limit."

1618710101.0,686,CLOV degenerates be careful,"Sigh... be careful CLOV degenerates. This high short interest stuff has already been debunked it looks like. The high short interest shown was a mistake by Factset and the short% of float is way way lower. Short interest is actually only about 35% of float, which is moderately high but not anywhere remotely close to the 145% being spread around.

1. Institutional shares like Vanguard that are counted in the post are freely tradable and are never deducted from a float calculation.
2. Clover’s publicly traded equity are Class A shares. Clover’s CEO only holds Class B shares. The screenshot shows that FactSet accidentally thought CEO Garipalli’s 83 million Class B shares were Class A shares. They were not, but because of the mistake FactSet subtracted them from the calculation of Class A float, which led to the mistakenly low number.

In other words, the screenshot of the “evidence” actually debunks this thesis.

There are about 109.8 million shares in the free float, and FactSet, Bloomberg, and Reuters are now all in agreement on that. But when FactSet subtracted 83 million from that by mistake it made it look like the float was only \~27 million (109.8 - 83) which made it look like the short interest as a % of float was massive.

FactSet corrected their numbers today. S3 Partners (which was cited in media and relied on FactSet) will likely correct next, then the handful of media articles that cited S3 (and indirectly FactSet) will probably correct as well.

There are actually a ton of shares available to short (30 million) according to IHS Markit, another short data provider. The cost to borrow is cheap at about 1.5-2%. None of this is consistent with a squeeze scenario.

Want to find high short interest names like everyone else but this is just not the one.

EDIT: S3 has now corrected their short interest based on the incorrect input from Factset, their SI% of float number has changed to 36.97% [https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1384112959329247236](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1384112959329247236)

[US Weekly Box Office Grosses \($\) - Source: Bloomberg 4\/17\/21](https://preview.redd.it/tu8r6jo3rst61.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d0fced0cbc3ace032915b3d860fe811bead118f)

I know you Apes have been waiting to hit the big screen! Well Warner Bros. ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" has infused new life into the jungle and a struggling US box office in 2020, prompting an upward revision in 2Q estimates across Wall Street. Yet it's too soon to draw conclusions. Film delays and ""day-and-date,"" or studios streaming movies on the same day as their theatrical release, are risks.

***1)  ""Godzilla vs Kong"" to Top Box Office Again***

It's is expected to top box-office charts for a third consecutive weekend with an estimated $8.7 million, bringing gross receipts to $82.6 million, according to Box Office Pro. California's ArcLight shut down last week, Regal's staggered reopening will continue, so the lack of new films this week should pull total receipts 25-30% lower, based on Box Office Pro estimates. ArcLight and Regal should give AMC an edge going into final spring months and even the early months of the summer when Box Office blockbusters usually get released.

***2) US Vaccine Available To All in 2Q; Theatres Also Gets Shot in Arm With Reopenings***

With cinemas only gradually reopening, 1Q21's box office totaled just under $240 million, an 87% plunge from the $1.83 billion in 1Q20. While that's not totally surprising, 2Q results will be much better, given the success of ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" even with only 55% of cinemas open. As Regal & AMC reopens more of its theaters in April, 2Q box office may hit $650 million, based on Box Office pro's projections, despite Disney's decision to release highly anticipated summer movies ""Cruella"" and ""Black Widow"" on its Disney+ service at the same time as they're available in theaters. Warner's ""Mortal Kombat"" will be out on April 16.

***3)  'Godzilla vs. Kong' Monstrous Open Roars Box Office Back to Life Around the World***

Following a strong international open, Warner Bros. ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" U.S. release had high expectations leading into the long Easter weekend. Those receipts, coming in slightly above the $13.5 million [the studio initially reported](https://variety.com/2021/film/news/box-office-godzilla-vs-kong-nobody-1234948900/) on Sunday, propel the film’s overall tally to $70 million. After two weeks of release, “[Godzilla vs. Kong](https://variety.com/t/godzilla-vs-kong/)” already ranks as the highest-grossing movie of the pandemic era, surpassing Christoper Nolan’s puzzling sci-fi thriller “Tenet,” which ended its theatrical run with $58.4 million.  (Source: Variety Magazine / Variety.com).  This as a step in the right direction leading into the summer blockbuster period as hybrid day-and-date release strategies aren't deterring fans from the theatrical experience. As more vaccines are distributed and theater capacity restrictions are relaxed, expect continued higher box-office receipts.

***4)  AMC Re-Opens California Cinema To Kick-Off Summer Early***

In a small step toward recovery in the global film industry, AMC, the largest theater operator in the world, announced the reopening of 54 of its California locations in March. Disney’s “Raya and the Last Dragon” is projected to take the weekend’s top spot, while Roadside Attraction’s “The Courier” are other notable new films releasing this weekend.

***5) Wall Street ""Hate-Love"" Relationship***

Wall Street analysts absolutely HATED the stock in 2020. From May 2020 to March 2021 there wasn't a single BUY rating. B. Riley analyst Eric Wold was the FIRST to put a BUY rating on AMC since the pandemic. On Friday he said that the CEO’s comments on the share authorization should be interpreted as good news on AMC’s cash position for the year.

On Wednesday, Aron told YouTube host Trey Collins in an interview on “Trey’s Trades”: “We hereby pledge at AMC that if the shareholders approve this authorization for 500 million new shares to be issued we will not use one of those 500 million shares in calendar year 2021. Not one. Not one.”

Aron also said AMC still has authorization to issue 43 million shares “that we could use if we wish to raise some cash, if we decide that’s a good idea. We have made no decisions yet. We are thinking about it, but we haven’t made any decisions yet.” Excerpts of the interview were [disclosed in a securities filing ](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000110465921050489/tm2113075d1_defa14a.htm)dated Thursday.

***5) AMC Lightens Up Debt Like GME***

Like all companies, going into the pandemic highly levered (with tons of debt) wasn't a good idea, which is not surprising that so many hedge funds went after GME and AMC. GME recently announced that they are going to be debt free and AMC also lightened up their load this year when various PE firms like Silver Lake and Mudrick coverted their convertible notes into equity.

[AMC's debt in coming years is low and at a very low interest rate \(sub 3&#37;\), with the majority of its callable debt maturing in 2026. The company is now generating cash flow again which will easily have plenty of runway to get them through 2021 and to 2026. They should have no liquidity issues this year so as long as theatres continue to re-open. \(Source: Bloomberg 4\/17\/21\)](https://preview.redd.it/o6kgwc4f9ut61.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b8df16a0de21a46980107df20eeb7e1e4df7387)

***6) SHORT INTEREST BACK UP***

Almost at 100% utilization, and 93.92MM shares short interest, next week will be interesting. Borrowing rates have also jumped back up this week. For those who are hoping for a gamma squeeze or short squeeze, I'm sure there are tons of you already reading other DDs and watching YouTube videos so I don't need to explain here. We're all here to make money. I'll be honest, I did a YOLO bet using AMC Call Options on the first pump up to $20 in late Jan and paperhanded and took gainz on the ride up. Now that the stock has pulled back to a decent level, this time I'm using shares, as there is just way too much market manipulation going on in the weekly options expirations with the market makers. This week, I saw tons of tutes coming in buying big blocks (100,000 to 1,000,000 share blocks) of AMC throughout the week, and I started accumulating from the high $8 range. Will continue to watch the MaxPain and options activity in coming days and weeks and play the trading range in addition to HOLDing shares.

1618690782.0,160,Explanation of the $CLOV 10k and Calculating Short Interest by hand,"Edit: I seem to be getting downvoted a lot, yet not a single person has replied criticizing my math and the numbers....

TL;DR: The real short interest is 35.1% and the data provider which first reported 140% has changed it back to this number. Also, I apologize in advance for disrupting the echo chamber.

Over the last two days many people all over every social media platform have been in debate as to what $CLOV's real float count is and what the real short interest as a % of the Float is. I am here to explain what went wrong in FactSet's calculations (which have now been fixed BTW: [source](https://imgur.com/gallery/HocOE0G)) and to calculate the float by hand using information and data provided in $CLOV's 10k to confirm the validity. Feel free to criticize any of the data presented.

Here are some facts that are not being widely disputed for reference:

* There are 145,345,832 Class A shares outstanding -[source](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312521102551/d89571d10k.htm)
* The CEO owns 0 Class A shares -[source](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312521102551/d89571d10k.htm)
* There are 38,504,281 Shares Short as of March 31st 2021- source: FactSet can't provide link but it seems as though this figure is not being disputed.

What is being disputed specifically is the number of shares that are part of the publicly traded float:

Yesterday FactSet reported that float was \~26.3M shares down from what they were reporting 2 days ago at \~109.8M shares. FactSet had subtracted 83.5M shares from the float making the denominator in the SI/Float equation plummet causing the short interest% to skyrocket to 140%+. FactSet incorrectly made this subtraction. **The CEO's shares were NEVER part of FactSet's calculated Float to begin with.** FactSet's float had always consisted of tradable Class A shares, yet it subtracted the CEO's Class B shares from the float. My guess is that someone challenged the data provided by FactSet and an analyst at FactSet changed the number according to the challenge but did not spend the time to properly verify the validity of the data they were changing. Now the number has been changed back to 109M shares float.

&#x200B;

Now for the 10k:

&#x200B;

[10K color coded](https://preview.redd.it/asn64bf8hst61.jpg?width=1708&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e98280fa82eb00501fdaa8e5d10d811a678b65f0)

This 10k is very easily misinterpreted without looking at the subscripts at the bottom. There is so much overlap when it comes to shares owned. Reading the subscript #3 at the bottom we can see that **Chamath's 30M shares are overlapped with the 20M and 10M shares owned by SCH Sponser III LLC and ChaChaCha SPAC C LLC** respectively. This means that the shares owned by SCH Sponsor III LLC + the shares owned by ChaChaCha SPAC C LLC + the shares owned by Chamath's = 30,500,000.

Further, Entities affiliated with Ian Osborne also own 25,500,000 Class A shares. As we above, 20,500,000 of those shares are from SHC Sponsor III LLC **which are already included in Chamath's 30,500,000 Class A shares.** This leaves an extra 5M shares owned by Ian Osborne that are not related to entities owned by Chamath.

Therefore, there are 30,500,000 + 5,000,000 = 35,500,000 Class A shares owned by Insiders and locked up. **The rest, 145,345,832 - 35,500,000 =  109,845,832, are part of the Float.**

Taking the #of shares short and dividing by the Float that we calculated gives us:

(38,504,281 /  109,845,832) \* 100 = **35.05301958 % of float being shorted.**

Now to clear up some more misconceptions:

[Vanguard's 26,185,529 Class A shares](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000110465921049151/tv0001-cloverhealthinvestmen.htm) are completely tradable and not locked up whatsoever and therefore, are still part of the float.

*Processing img qxzqcfeajst61...*

It is clear from a close reading of the 10k that there are many things wrong with the data here:

1. Vanguard should not be considered as part of the Class A Lockup shares since they can freely trade AND lend shares. Therefore, those 26,185,529 shares **should not** be subtracted from the shares outstanding.
2. The creator of this table failed to realize that Chamath's 30M shares are the same as SCH Sponsor III and ChaChaCha SPAC C's shares and mistakenly subtracts them from the shares outstanding twice. Further, 20M of Ian Osborne's shares are wrongly being subtracted as well since they are overlapped with SCH Sponsor III."
1618690626.0,393,Extremely thorough CLOV recent action DD,"I’m going to go back a little bit in time and tell you how CLOV was directly related to GME squeeze.
So when GME was squeezing two very influential people have backed the squeeze and caused it to squeeze even more. Those two people were Elon Musk and Chamath Palihapitiya. Both partners in previous endeavors and friends. 
GME squeeze hurt short seller Hindenburg so much that they have lost 40% of their account that week. 
CLOV is backed by Chamath Palihapitiya. Hindenburg, in order to retaliate at Chamath for causing them huge losses, published a short seller report for CLOV few days after Chamath tweeted about GME. Short seller report had very little base, yet that caused the stock to drop and also SEC had to initiate an investigation due to the claims. 
Since then stock got beaten down to less than IPO prices. What does that mean? It means that it was moved not so much by true owners of the stock, but mostly by short sellers. That will play in nicely in the squeeze because short sellers always have to close out, but if stock is still held by their true purchasers it means that there are even less shares available for active trading. 



Enough of history. Retail following:

Since GME endeavor Chamath PAlihapitiya joined the club of “retail gods”.... he is one of the poster babies for retail movement on hurting short sellers. His previous partnerships with Elon Musk furthers retail following so now not only we have GME crowd supporting Chamath, but also Tesla crowd. Both of those stocks were some of the most successful trades in history. 



Friday’s Hindenburg’s fright with CLOV:

On Friday CLOV has opened with 148% short interest and after this was noticed by retail the squeeze has started. The volume topped 250M shares traded (10x average daily volume and 5x its previous heaviest volume day). (Ill get in to more technicals later, but needed to mention this to push the narrative).
Hindenburg saw the action and protecting their possible short position tweeted that FactSet has misleading short interest data about CLOV not including CEOs clad B shares in the float. 
FactSet came back to Hindenburg’s allegations with a reply that CEOs type B shares are classified as not tradable and are not included in the float. And once again confirmed that stock is 148% short.
This further angered retail traders and a lot of chatter online has started how Hindenburg is trying to manipulate this stock with lies and deceit. 
A lot of people didn’t catch on on Friday but through the night and this afternoon Reddit and stock twits seem to have exploded about it, videos are popping up on YouTube. A lot of traction is being created over the weekend for a sweet Monday open. 



Technicals:
*CLOV free float is 109mil 
*CLOV shares outstanding are 406mil
*78% of CLOV shares are owed by insiders and are still locked up. Insiders are only allowed to sell if stock hits $30 and stays above $30 for 90 days 
*institutional ownership of CLOV is at 48%

*the volume on Friday was 249mil shares which only represents 61% turn over for shares outstanding, but if you take locked up shares out of consideration, true turn over was actually 228%, meaning every share available to trade was bought and sold at least twice on Friday. 

A lot of people that bought on Friday (including NEXT financial group that bought 21,400 shares) will not likely be actively trading this week meaning available shares short term will continue on decreasing.

In my speculation out of 109 mil free float Only around 35% of shares will be available to trade this week. Here is how I got to this number: 
-institutions owe 48% of stock and they are not likely to trade short term fluctuations, but giving it a benefit of doubt let’s say that institutions that will hold account only to 30% of float. Now we only have 70% of float left to trade....
-let’s assume that investors that owe CLOV long term account for 20% of the float. A lot of them don’t check stocks daily or sometimes even weekly. Let’s assume that half of them even won’t notice what is happening this week. At this point we only have 50% of float left to trade. 
-the rest of the free float is being traded by scalpers/ day traders, swing traders and “diamond handers”. This is a very educated group and unless scalping or pattern trading will understand that we are in the middle of the squeeze and hold. I believe this group will contribute to another 15% of float being unavailable, assuming half of them will be trading fluctuations and half holding. 
So my conclusion is: only 35% of available shares will be circulating next week being sold and bought over and over again. That’s only 38mil shares not being stuck in someone’s account semi permanently. Some more liquidity will be provided short term by other shorters flocking in, but I won’t take them in consideration because they too have to close out at some point. 

Fallowing all this speculative, yet very carefully vetted math let’s calculate the demand for the shares, just to close short positions
-148% of the free float is shorted, meaning 161mil shares will be in demand just to close out short positions. Since we already established that there will be only 38mil shares freely circulating in the market each short share will only have 0.24 shares. So looks like there are 4 times less shares than demand to close short positions! Throw in some buying activity to that math and you have a number closer to 10:1. 

Following all of that the question is how far the stock can go during this particular squeeze? Well the answer is: it’s mathematically impossible to calculate. Although there are some indicators of what people can expect. Smaller the float, the bigger the short interest and the heavier the volume the further it can go. In this particular instance we have the combination of all three factors. Even if it’s impossible to predict exactly what price short squeeze will hit, it’s possible to trade short squeeze well using technical indicators and trade management. Monitoring volume, daily short interest and days to cover should be adequate. To know when short squeeze is ending I monitor same indicators that made me spot the short squeeze to start with, but in reverse. Meaning volume will start to tapper off, short percentage decrease and the upwards momentum will start to whilt. I also watch out for extremely sudden, needle like falls (trailing stop loss domino effect). 

I hope the read was interesting and I haven’t lost you half way through. 

I won’t go into any CLOV fundamentals or any of that good stuff cause I think we already established that everything is in order there. It is also completely irrelevant in a mathematical squeeze."

Only included stocks (ETF's) with 1 or more years history. Did NOT include the ARKX fund or Ark Space Exploration & Innovation ETF since it is less than 1 month old, with a March 30,2021 inception date.

Hard to believe but the results AND charts speak for themselves .

&#x200B;

Even if you took out the March 2020 LOW prices and went with January 2020 or February 2020 highs (high share prices BEFORE the Covid19 or coronavirus stock market crash of March 2020),the results are nevertheless extremely impressive.

&#x200B;

High performance over one performance may be attributed to luck by SOME investors but when you consistently have greater than 20% yearly returns over 7 different stocks (or ETF's),then that is WORLD CLASS stock market skill. You are doing something RIGHT.

Cathie Wood is a genuinely extraordinary and extremely aggressive stock picker and analyst. No doubt about that. Her far above average results speak volumes about her skills and abilities.

&#x200B;

Extremely transparent stock picker who shockingly reports her various ETF's investments on a DAILY basis. Not monthly or weekly.

Love the transparency. Very, very unusual.

Let's look at her track record : Specializing in actively managed ETF's that focus on ""INNOVATION"" is obviously her success or stock market secret.

&#x200B;

All prices from March 2020 to February 2021.How the charts look like over the long-term for this extraordinary ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) or ARK Innovation ETF : 

Judge the ETF's on a minimum 9 to 12 months term basis, not over a 1 to 3 month or short-term basis.

&#x200B;

What’s the difference between a mutual fund and an ETF?

In both mutual funds and ETFs, investors are effectively pooling cash to buy assets by buying shares in the fund. However, mutual funds can only be purchased at the end of each trading day, while ETFs can be bought and sold INTRADAY.

Mutual funds tend to have higher minimum investment requirements and often charge higher fees.

""For most investors, ETFs are more tax efficient, as their structure allows them to minimize capital gains"".

Although both come in actively-managed and passive forms, the majority of ETFs track indexes, while mutual funds are more commonly actively run by an investment manager.

How does the business work? Cohu makes capital equipment for testing semi’s. They have two businesses, selling capital equipment to other firms, and offering testing to companies that want to outsource that process. 

We all know that there is a global semiconductor shortage, which is a strong catalyst. But the real catalyst is increasing volume. The number of semiconductors per phone is increasing. With 5g devices, there are nearly twice as many chips per phone as compared to 4g. This means twice as much testing. Additionally, with the move to electric vehicles, the automotive testing segment is growing rapidly. Cars that used to have only a few chips, are now crammed full of them. This trend of increasing chip volume is true for PC’s, phones, electric vehicles, self driving vehicles, IOT, cloud computing, and ai development. All of these growing industries have one thing in common, the need for lots of semiconductors to continue driving innovation. 

Financially cohu is a very attractive stock, even having nearly tripled in the past year. With a nice 42% profit margin and growing revenues, the company is still fairly priced. Ttm gross profit is 271 million, compared to their market cap of 2.3 billion. This is a market cap/profit ratio of 8.48.

1618669833.0,48,$TECH will break its $420 resistance on 4/20,"Hello apes and autists,

I've seen some tendies get thrown around the CRISPR space lately with all the $EDIT talk which is great to see as I feel I can finally contribute something meaningful to r/WSB.  I assume you apes have had a little exposure to the Cell & Gene Therapy (C&GT) industry when you're jerkin off on the couch to Cathie Woods and her $ARKG fund while your wife and her boyfriend are in the master bedroom, but then again probably not.  So, please read the preamble before throwing your shit all over my DD.

**Key Points on Cell and Gene Therapy Industry**

C&GT is a long time in the making and many (including several Nobel prize winning) discoveries had to coalesce but the industry is finally starting to hit major inflection points. One of the major subcategories within C&GT are ""cell-based gene therapies"" like CAR-T cell therapy. A patient's (or donor's) T cell is genetically engineered to express a CAR which drives the T cell towards the cancer cells. There are 5 FDA approved CAR-T cell therapies on the market. Below is a table from Wikipedia with more info on them.

https://preview.redd.it/wk1h7t06sqt61.png?width=2228&format=png&auto=webp&s=798b37452937b4018f93f1939d5794ca80d2fc1a

There are many other subcategories within C&GT and many other types of ""cell-based gene therapies"" beyond CAR-T cell therapy.  Not all of these require genetic engineering, FYI.

On January 15, 2019 commissioners from the [FDA issued a bullish statement](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/statement-fda-commissioner-scott-gottlieb-md-and-peter-marks-md-phd-director-center-biologics) on the C&GT industry and here are some highlights:

1. ""The FDA is witnessing a surge of cell and gene therapy products entering early development, evidenced by a large upswing in the number of investigational new drug (IND) applications.""
2. ""We anticipate that by 2020 we will be receiving more than 200 INDs per year, building upon our total of more than 800 active cell-based or directly administered gene therapy INDs currently on file with the FDA.""
3. ""And by 2025, we predict that the FDA will be approving 10 to 20 cell and gene therapy products a year based on an assessment of the current pipeline and the clinical success rates of these products.

&#x200B;

When you look at the [FDA's IND Receipts for Biologics](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/ind-activity/ind-receipts) in 2018, we see that 1594 INDs were filed. This was a below average year compared to the 1614 (+/-70) INDs that were filed, on average, from 2014 through 2019. It is important to remember that there was a ""surge"" of C&GT products entering the early development landscape BEFORE the pandemic because this implies that the share of C&GT IND receipts is growing in a pie of \~1600 new INDs per year. In 2020, the FDA received 2182 INDs.

The ""surge"" in C&GT products entering early development the FDA noted in their early 2019 statement was a mere prelude to the 2020 surge in C&GT therapy products entering early development as evidenced by large upswings in the number of new INDs.

Unfortunately, there are many risks involved with investing in early, mid, or late stage biologic drug developers because of their high cash burn rate and constant threat of dilution. Obviously the tendies can be nice if some of these companies get acquired but that's a tough game to play. IMO, you are much better off finding a company that provides the C&GT industry with all the reagents, consumables, and instruments that these developers and institutions use to conduct R&D and development work. **Enter, $TECH**.

[Bio-techne](https://www.bio-techne.com/) is a NE Minneapolis, MN based company that has largely grown through acquisitions. It's largest subsidiary is R&D Systems, a company that has been providing research grade reagents to the biotech industry for 50 years. That brand is well known and have a great reputation. They have quietly acquired many other brands quite strategically which will enable them to service the growing C&GT industry new ways like: GMP reagents for use in the expanding clinical and commercial landscape, gene editing technology (including CRISPR/Cas9 and other non-viral methods), contract development and manufacturing services, analytical instrumentation and assays, etc. [See here for full list of Bio-techne brands.](https://www.bio-techne.com/about/bio-techne-brands) 

 

**The Metaphorical Stars Align**

Not only is $TECH a fundamentally sound company with strong analyst reviews (see my E\*Trade snapshot below), but stars are soon to be aligning that you apes need to be aware of.

**On 4/20, $TECH will break through its $420 resistance**. I mean come on, this is too good to be true right? See my shitty technical analysis below for confirmation bias. Everything seems to be lining up.

 **TL;DR:** If you like $EDIT, $ARKG, or any other hot cell and gene therapy companies like $CRSP, $FATE, etc. but do not want to invest in cell and gene therapy developers directly (because of risk), then $TECH is for you. Not only has $TECH supported the biotech field with reagents, assays, and instrumentation for 40 years, they will continue to take market share in the rapidly growing clinical/commercial (non-R&D) groups. Finally, their stonk will break through the $420 resistance on 4/20."

# Purpose

To be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here. WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts can crush Wall Street analysts at places like Morningstar or M-Fool. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation or cooperation.

* Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? **(Square DD Complete)**
* How do we compare social media incentives? **(Pinterest DD Complete)**
* What really is customer service? **(GameStop DD Complete)**
* Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? **(Kansas City Southern Rail DD Complete)**
* What are elements behind US lagging industrial sector? **(Autodesk DD Complete)**
* Do we understand the consequences of STEAM education (Science, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics)? **(YOU ARE HERE)**
* Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? **(Cloud Compute DD in Progress)**
* How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?

# Video Games & Heutagogic Learning

It appears clear these days that video games are the most dominant form of media. This is because the video game industry can better access and more aggressively capture our high-barrier entry need for adventure and journey. Other industries compete with this element but ultimately place their customers in the spectator's seat. For example:

1. The short stories on social media like Snapchat, Instagram, Youtube, or Twitter.
2. The hero tales created by Disney or Netflix.

&#x200B;

[Gaming as the leader in entertainment or media](https://preview.redd.it/xms6g6ksvpt61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=e84e0655c99280e464931f3da513e33404fbdee6)

One must remember that the attention-economy fundamentally depends on on key metric: **engagement**. It is no secret why organizations like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, or even Tesla have further intersected with gaming in aggressive maneuvers in recent years as a result of this economic condition. Gaming is a big winner of the attention-economy and often sits at the frontier of new economies.  When looking at age, gaming or other medias can be the shortest path to reaching new or lifelong customers. It is a lucrative and difficult position to acquire or maintain.

&#x200B;

Think of it historically; during the first iterations of the web, many customers were fearful of putting credit-card information online while online gaming companies have ventured into selling branded debit cards that sold to children and youth that otherwise did not have access to banking. Roblox takes this nature a step further by effectively defining and supporting Robux-to-fiat economy as the lifeblood of the company.

&#x200B;

[First generation fintech and banking services](https://preview.redd.it/72qme0crxpt61.png?width=353&format=png&auto=webp&s=cadb26b801c61afe73a8a96cb16a0024c66e316b)

I’ve discussed internet media, user incentives, and their distinctions in a previous DD involving Pinterest. To highlight one of main ideas:

>""An internet forum may take on a different medium, but it is ultimately a forum none the less. In my view, it ranks like the following list, where the top rank is the most inelastic due to human behavior. If we try to categorize it roughly, the forums would look like this:

1. Google is fueled by customer’s need for answered information.
2. Online video games are fueled by a customer’s need for adventure.
3. Reddit is fueled by a customer’s need for community.
4. Pinterest is fueled by a customer’s need for ideas.
5. Facebook is fueled by a customer’s need to connect.""

In this DD, I would argue that gaming is one of the most comprehensive applications of internet forums that can encapsulate all of the needs above and dig deeper into the ideas that drive it.

&#x200B;

[The investment incentive: low barrier to entry & decentralized game development](https://preview.redd.it/hmibns2pzpt61.png?width=1303&format=png&auto=webp&s=a08c1a1680665d6f9272f3cff8ab19bb68f3f3ed)

I typically do not like to assert authority on a subject when I write DD, but I feel that in this case it is necessary due to an enormous complexities behind education technology, what's wrong with it, and what needs to be corrected.  In short, my view is that video games are one of the most powerful ways to engage students in a meaningful and long-lasting education, ranging from social to reading skills.

&#x200B;

[Heutagogic learning](https://preview.redd.it/rq9dxj9yzpt61.png?width=591&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4fbe53adde74b85313ca4dca53077e14de64983)

Online games fulfill a similar shortcoming that traditional medias fail in regards to adventure or journey.  In the same fashion, education and the art of teaching generally stutters when the student remains a spectator for too long.  What gaming achieves as an education service are all the critical requirements of a healthy STEM education:

&#x200B;

1. The ability to inspire curiosity and confidence.
2. The ability to deeply engage.
3. The ability to produce imagination or creativity.

Some of us may scoff about this, but there is a lot of truth to this sentiment that I believe many would agree with. For many early online child gamers, skills like typing quickly, bartering, multiplying, reading comprehension, or the desire to pursue arts originates from our time spent engaged by video games.

This is the goal and nature of heutagogic learning. This nature extends to adulthood, as many of us experienced this phenomenon while learning about advanced financial instruments for the sake of ""learning the game""  of stock market investing. We spend time scowering through forums and generating a community no different than that of popular online games.  Many of us have even acquired generational knowledge as a result of this media condition. We have met the proper requirements and incentives for a STEM education at scale.

[Andragogic\/Heutagogic learning at scale](https://preview.redd.it/gplo1bx41qt61.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=715bae2a0ff447bd5d21569bcac401c636c69dae)

I could talk length about this subject alone, but simply put, the world is not quite ready to accept such an idea. Games are still seen as entertainment, but it typically evolves each generation. In my generation, three societal transformations occurred:

1. It stopped being weird to purchase in-game cosmetics.
2. The idea of watching others play video games was normalized.
3. E-Sports became popular and inspired a new economy.

&#x200B;

[Second generation online gaming](https://preview.redd.it/4bt555i62qt61.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c281084802f3ff72cb8143b40761bde4fa9e5ed)

Some of these resistances are interesting when you look at it from a simpler lens. Why was it weird to watch others play video games online, when it was seemingly normal to watch someone play Dance Dance Revolution in an arcade or an older sibling progress through a game? Why was it strange to purchase cosmetic goods where we spend a large percentage of our time in digital worlds? Why was it bizarre to see dedicated players compete at global levels when gaming and online access became a worldwide normalcy? Usually there is no good reason for the psychological resistance to change.

Yet here we are, playing and learning effectively one of the most popular mobile games in the US.

# STEAM Pedagogy - Arts in STEM

&#x200B;

[STEAM pedagogy for architecture, engineering, or construction](https://preview.redd.it/b57peu7j2qt61.png?width=2782&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e6ce51e01691091ff6dbeee88ff1dad985a2ff7)

With that idea covered, I want to transition to examine one of the leading pedagogies in US education, which is the inclusion of arts in STEM, known as a STEAM pedagogy.  It may not be immediately clear why the inclusion is such a drastic change to STEM, but one should consider several factors:

1. STEM education standards are poor with low engagement (a societal problem)
2. Good science and engineering requires confident students (resisting imposter syndrome)
3. STEM requires creativity and imagination (critical thinking requisites)

&#x200B;

[Game development, code, or design](https://preview.redd.it/556dqhnp3qt61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6b4a2ac6c89a435890fcd01210026208aae9337)

What an arts education does is fundamentally produce new language and learning skills that are actively applied in a STEM education. Typically speaking, arts is also far more engaging to youth while traditional STEM learning models can carry less obvious inherent incentives.

However, slowly but surely, we are beginning to see students who seek to learn digital art, coding, investing and other STEAM-derived interests that can transition into other branches of STEM as a result of incentivizing the desire to learn these skills.

A young Roblox game developer is only a short path away from finding a passion in architecture or cloud computing. This strategy is not new and has had success for organizations like Adobe, Microsoft, Autodesk, and other technical skills. These are largely andragogic forms of learning, or adult-centered educations.

&#x200B;

One of the most significant accomplishments of the inclusion of Arts in a STEM-centered education is the inversion of a question that afflicted many classrooms for generations:

>“Why do I need to learn this?”

It turns out, the answer is not

>“so you can become a scientist!”

but to provide an environment that encourages and incentivizes a proper learner's mentality

>“I need to learn this, so that I can create that.”

&#x200B;

Engineers and scientists are simply disciplined creators no different than an artist or performer. However, there are significant and clear barriers to entry to STEM-based and Arts-based learning. It is far more pragmatic for a child to inspire creative behaviors with a canvas, skateboard, or instrument while the barrier to entry for engineering practices may be far less accessible.

Some of this is partially a consequence of time, where there has been less knowledge transfer on writing software vs. writing prose and some of these barriers have compounding consequences at the socioeconomic level.  For example, there is a large disparity in big tech hirings, and such consequences can carry over to other multi-trillion dollar industries driven by infrastructure and Green New Deal policies.

&#x200B;

[Socioeconomic consequences in education support](https://preview.redd.it/t2mh2ikz3qt61.png?width=987&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ed2aadf47bb21e36d44864efe58303c20119d74)

Another huge barrier to entry to STEM is simply the fact that many students do not believe in themselves or have not been encouraged to imagine that they are capable of achieving success in subjects like mathematics and science, so there is an enormous amount of undue self-filtering in the field. Learning how to dance is a far more engaging practice to a child, while learning how to code in some developer environment without the proper incentive may seem pointless. Organizations like Roblox can and are changing the equation for some students.

You may be at a loss at this point, but it's worth taking the time to simply ponder on this and what it means economically for Roblox. The language used here is directly aligned with the language used in the Roblox S-1 registration document:

1. Inspiration mentioned 9 times.
2. Create and inspiration mentioned 75 times.
3. Engagement mentioned 160 times.

This language is particular due to the game identifying with its original iteration, Interactive Physics, an education game that launched in 1989.

>""The story of Roblox began in 1989 when our founders, David Baszucki and Erik Cassel, programmed a 2D simulated physics lab called Interactive Physics, which would later go on to influence our approach to building the groundwork for Roblox. Students across the world used Interactive Physics to see how two cars would crash, or how they could build destructible houses. In starting Roblox in 2004, we wanted to replicate the inspiration of imagination and creativity we saw in Interactive Physics on a much grander scale by ushering in a new category of human interaction that did not exist at the time.""

# The Roblox Vision

>""We focus our business on our developers, creators, and users, and acting in their interests in the long-term may conflict with the short-term expectations of analysts and investors.""

&#x200B;

[EBP - Engagement Based Payouts started in 2020](https://preview.redd.it/z63prfzr6qt61.png?width=467&format=png&auto=webp&s=faad3efe3a156c1f26e4adadefb20346466bb37e)

Understanding the nature of modern-day cloud computing and its future direction will allow investors to understand the paths that Roblox will take. The fundamental theory of this economy is that a customer's data is an increasingly tangible asset. The way that I like to examine the economic output of this industry is by two core economic elements.

1. The value of work generated by machine-to-machine transactions (network output).
2. The value of data and services generated by human experiences (customer input).

[Serverless computing - network service architecture for real-time and powerful apps.](https://preview.redd.it/wl88yq547qt61.png?width=1376&format=png&auto=webp&s=618f6be99e0b7cc157065b4505cb82d7f89d5e36)

There are many organizations that capture the essence of this industry. Organizations like Square and Zoom will provide services that we're all familiar with, but we often forget the under-hood-details that exist and govern the infrastructure of these companies. What cloud computing organizations have realized is that as our engagement with platforms increases, the value of our data and needs becomes increasingly tangible. Our needs for financial technology or property rentals have resulted in regulatory or social challenges, which we typically refer to as ""disruption"". The disruption is rooted in the fact that our data is an authentically tangible good.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vpzpov6deqt61.png?width=845&format=png&auto=webp&s=0128b3dd2ee4912161dbfc99c9d312b8f57f9b6c

&#x200B;

This idea that our data and time spent on digital platforms is the central hypothesis behind creation of the robux system that Roblox lives on. There are many things that Roblox needs to accomplish in the near to short term to achieve long-term profitability and the leadership seems to have a clear vision on how to achieve that:

1. The company will continue to redistribute its wealth back toward its developers.
2. The company will aggressively invest in education sectors to incentivize students to learn valuable skills.
3. The company will support wildly successful games as a way to create a long-term identity for Roblox (like popular Nintendo games)
4. The company will continue to invest in its cloud platform and eventually develop its own hardware platform to reduce its expenses.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jr21jf1b8qt61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8175cc302d2be55fe0e446f0b78dc71d6f1d4956

The reason that I'm certain of this is because the organization needs to accomplish the following incentives and financial feats:

1. Reached a large enough audience in order to maintain long-term relevancy.
2. Produced and support games that create enough incentive to join the platform.
3. Created enough incentives for developers to produce quality experiences.

&#x200B;

>""Roblox has a vibrant economy built on a currency called Robux, which can be purchased through the Roblox Client and website. Users can also acquire Robux through a monthly subscription to Roblox  
>  
>Premium. Developers and creators earn Robux by selling access to virtual content. Developers can also earn Robux by driving engagement of Premium subscribers through an engagement-based payout system. When Premium subscribers spend time in a developer’s experience, that developer earns a prorated share of the user’s monthly subscription fee. Engagement-based payouts incentivize developers to invest in the engagement of their experiences. Roblox allows developers and creators to convert earned Robux into the real-world currency of their choice through our Developer Exchange Program.""

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h95ts6pt8qt61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0406e17772f8f302bfdc4beb4eee288509e07440

In my view, Roblox's 2020 premium payout system will be one the biggest shifts in media as it has many potential outcomes that we aren't fully implemented yet. This is the nature of certain powerful architectures like computing more data at the edge or leaning on services like Fastly, Amazon Fargate, or other serverless/back-end platforms. Roblox is no such stranger to this and I would say that they certaintly have a vested interest in pushing these kinds of interactions.

Some uses cases of engagement-based payouts are repeatable to other platforms, where organizations like Reddit could easily implement similar financial logic if they discover that Reddit Subscribers spend the majority of their time to a small concentration of subreddits. This already exists to an extent, where users represent engagement through coin-sharing and reddit emoji placements.

Another example, if a high-quality education game were to be released on Roblox, where the developer agrees to redistribute their earned Robux to schools in need, then Roblox has achieved an economy where a student who is spending time learning has resulted in the improvement or construction of other learning facilities. This is also reflective of the idea that data is increasingly tangible.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bb9j3yj7aqt61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=8308e21dd05757fa74928a26560f665d0d61bf12

The possibilities with an engagement-based payout system are enormous for Roblox and produces added value to the ideas behind things like virtual concerts, streams, or other experiences that aren't fully realized in the gaming sector. For example, what is the economic consequence of children having a safe environment to attend concerts of their favorite artists? At the same time, the Robux payout system is a non-trivial distance away from creating applications of other alternative currencies like exchanging Robux with other digital assets like VBucks, tickets, or block-you-know-what-based applications.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1g33ivkwaqt61.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6ff4e2b37801f0ee02fa70d46b8fa636bc5455b

Another core element to Roblox's financial future is to ultimately secure its means of distribution. As it currently stands, the biggest expense to the Roblox platform is the fee processing it must agree to when it comes to doing business with organizations like Apple, Microsoft, Google, and other payment processors like Visa and Paypal. One way to reduce these costs and increase profitability is to develop products akin to the Nintendo Switch or Oculus platform. This idea is not too far away given the nature of Roblox's business, which has an enormous amount of various types of games that would be well-suited by Roblox partnerships. Overtime, the value of Apple or Google's distribution power weakens as the company cements itself into public consciousness.

&#x200B;

The company has alluded to this idea with an April fool's joke in 2019, with a console known as the imagination-powered Robox:

>"" At Roblox, we’re continuously exploring new and innovative ways to bring our platform to millions of people across the world. Just as we’ve expanded onto phones, tablets, the Xbox One, and virtual reality, we believe that there’s an even greater potential just waiting to be unlocked. A new way to experience all your favorite Roblox games. A new way to connect with your friends. A new way to make your dreams a reality in stunning, 8K ultra-high definition graphics and at greater than 120 frames per second.  
>  
>Welcome to a new era of interactive entertainment. This is **Robox**.""

# Conclusion

There was a lot of ground to cover here so let's briefly review. Gaming is arguably the best form of media in the attention-economy where Roblox identifies itself at the intersection of education and digital media development.

A significant portion of the education sector is focused on STEAM pedagogy which aligned with and supported by Roblox goals long-term. Roblox is able to leverage cloud computing to disrupt traditional models in gaming, education, financial technology, and imagination markets.

1618651169.0,1485,The Lucky Clover 🍀,"Edit: There have been multiple observations about $CLOV true short interest (different numbers from FactSet, S3 Partners, Bloomberg). As it's always the case, there is a lot of noise and the numbers I have are not watertight, so you should do your own work. What seems to hold though, is that $CLOV has been agressively beaten down by bears.

TL;DR  🍀 go brrrrr 🚀🚀🚀

Howdy degenerates!

I bet you saw the price action in $CLOV yesterday (+20%)? Turns out the shorts got greedy again -- close to 120% greedy.

What??? Haven't they learnt their lesson with $GME at once? Apparently not. The $GME squeeze has cost a bunch of hedge funds (Melvin, Maplelane, D1) billions in losses on top of their damaged reputation and 'prestige'.

These hedge funds hold a lot of grudge towards a few people that chipped in during the $GME squeeze of January 2021 -- namely Chamath. See excerpt from Greenlight Capital (David Einhorn's hedge fund) letter:

[Einhorn's April 15 letter to investors](https://preview.redd.it/f54gnkshapt61.png?width=1254&format=png&auto=webp&s=f408458520ba063250597ad9c2e270e73eddfb75)

Their weapon of choice -- shorting $CLOV, which was SPACed by Chamath.

Isn’t $CLOV a pos stock? No, and even if it is, this is irrelevant. As you already figured it out, most short squeezes are mostly math, however this may or may not unfold.

**$CLOV Short Interest:**

$CLOV has 118% short interest. Shorts will try an tell you that this is much lower. In fact that's exactly what Hindenburg tried to do yesterday. Hindenburg even e-mailed FactSet to counter S3 Partners data (although S3 calculation also seems to be incorrect). The table below is based on Clover's 10K + latest 13G filed by Vanguard, so should be very close to reality:

https://preview.redd.it/osbjmrweapt61.png?width=1324&format=png&auto=webp&s=77d1b36c6532e3d7e569cec2021a3fc7de03b37e

[This includes CEO's shares in the float -- it shouldn't. ](https://preview.redd.it/ypfw5kulapt61.png?width=862&format=png&auto=webp&s=49333325388e5108d6af6c4b6d5b9b15c797c210)

Shorts are intentionally including CEO's shares into the float to make it appear larger. This is boneheaded at best and intentionally deceitful at worst:

* The CEO (Vivek Garipalli) is the founder of $CLOV; the likelihood of him selling his shares is close to nil
* All his shares are Class B (10-to-1 voting ratio vs. Class A; only Class A shares are traded on the open market -- so they shouldn't be in the calculation in the first place), which means that if he sells or transfers his shares this will generally result in those shares converting to Class A (i.e. losing the supervoting feature)
* Even if he would decide to sell, the shares are still locked-up until July
* Management incentive plan is anchored at $30 per share. What this means is that the share price has to exceed $30 for 90 consecutive days in order for management plan RSUs to vest and be possible to sell

***What does this mean?***

What this means is that a very small amount of $CLOV shares are free to trade because \~78% of the shares are still owned by insiders, locked-up and not trading. It only takes a little bit of gamma fairy dust to make $CLOV move A LOT.

**Timing:**

Timing this is tricky. $CLOV is due to announce results on May 20th, so save for any good news, this would be our catalyst. 

To capture the biggest upside, the highest strike call options are the best for this. Currently the only May expiry options are 5/21 $30C (still cheap at $0.2). There is A LOT of calls OI for that date.

Inducing some gamma fairy dust so that MMs have to hedge with more shares, making the shorts cover, increasing the Delta of our call options further, would help getting there and beyond.

Remember $CLOV ATH was $17.45 -- even if ALL shorts opened positions at that level, they would be 70% underwater if it hits $30. If you add leverage (all hedge funds are levered), say 2x -- they would be looking at a forced cover / liquidation à la Archegos.

Obligatory: I am a financial degenerate and this is for entertainment purposes only; not investment advice.

The music for todays post is a tryptic. Play in this order.

**Hat in the Wind** \- **Themselves**

**Light Work - Prof**

**All that Glitters - Dead Elvis**

I spent today at work in a sort of elevated and removed state.  The feeling of wanting to puke in every trashcan you walk by mixed with the just-above-ground-floating-weightlessness of an empty portfolio. It was something akin to a cactus whose skin people drink in a jungle I was once in.  Truly my spirit is no longer burdened by excessive wealth. Was it even mine though.. Zen masters believe you reincarnate through every door you walk through, Someone real sensitive said ""May we always just begin to see our selves as something else and smile""

**Some of you, well let me correct myself, many of you will know this feeling.**  The brief apparition of gold that appears in the middle of a trade which does not deter you from continuing some sort of mad ascension, pressing the gas pedal to the floor as you rocket into Valhalla as fast as you smash out. I want to be with you and join your YOLO'd ranks. I know these 5 digits are nothing compared to the magnanimous losses that sit on red thrones much larger than mine but its all relative right.  Life is too short to be a bitch and chicks dig scars.

**The specific details are a blur.**  GOEV is a fast bitch.  She's got a lot to offer just not now.  What tony has in his hat will take probably months to percolate... Shorts are in control and will be now that retail has been absolutely beaten up.  They will probably bail in some shape or form one of the first chances they get.  **There will always be a core group of supporters which I am one of. I really believe in the tech.  I believe that they have the power to disrupt transportation like the Model T did.**

News will be released soon and I would say that its going to be on a scale of -10 which is Lawsuits have traction to 10 which is Apple Car.  Factory and manufacturing partner with some pre-orders is probably a 5-7 depending... You're going to need an 8+ to kick off a naughty squeeze... Or someone will have to take on the unified shorts in the sector. The big move will be convincing institutions to buy in and catch the paper hands of the bailing retail.  Canoo must have a better ground game.  This will either be Cloughvis (God damnit I cant even use your ticker you absolute piece of shit stock because your market cap is too weak for WSB)or CLOV, Canoo gets to pick.  (Watch news drop tomorrow lulz).  Most good stock value plays are pain trains until they are not.

**Personally I need to learn to take gains**, be a bit less believing in my own confirmation bias bullshit.  I need to add a few months if not more to most options plays.  I also need to dark side a bit more and also run spreads. I also have to realize. Shorts are fucking violent and can bring pain.  They don't give up easy and fight on multiple fronts.

**Anyways I would like to thank all of you who joined me on this descent** into a sort of infatuated madness that could only be described as the autistic form of dementia that Lewis Carrol suffered from.  The following is a list of names and by no means is exhaustive but its the ones I can find right now.  I will continue to add as I re-read all the kind messages people have sent.  It has been a strange and crazy trip friends.

I do want to leave this, let me dismount my one trick pony and talk about the past and the future.

**I've spent a lot of time in the past getting into fist fights with death** (and only sometimes winning) and I realized that money doesn't mean a lot.  There's a certain level of financial stability which gets you to a point where you have everything on auto-pay and that works as long as you don't piss off your boss or still like your job. But its really just another stress in life. Enough money will buy you a seat next to the window at the SNF or all the experiences in life you can want.  But that yellow stretcher doesn't give a fuck where it finds you...  It will be there for you one day just the same. Please don't fucking waste your time its all you have. My **Hurt Circus** people will know what I'm talking about all lights, sirens boots on and beard on fire.

But fuck it, I want to be rich.

**The future,** at least as it pertains to this particular writing project of mine will be a rags to riches project.  We'll see if I have what it takes.  I'm open to suggestions of tickers or if you want me to write on something particular send it over and I'll give it a look. I encourage you to upload your own GOEV loss porn in the comments. But also if you won. Maybe show that off to...

But in the meantime I'll see you there.

Be well.

1618627541.0,77,Important: the $clov short interest doesn't seem to be around 150% as the news tell us.,"Around 400 million shares exist of clov. There are class a and class b shares.
Only 145 million shares are outstanding.
The other shares are locked.
The float is something between 110 million (yahoo) and 144 million (bloomberg).
What happened?
To calculate the short interest they reduced the float by the 83 million owned by the CEO.
This leads to a new float of 26 million.
This is the float the media is referencing.
Only the CEO shares are already included in the 255 million shares, that are locked.
The real float still is between 110 and 144 million.
So with 39 million shares shortet, the short interest is really between 27 and 36 %.

The volume today was 244 million and the short volume 89 million (fintel)
This would also be very hard to reach with a float of 26 million.

I think this is huge. People bought because of this data or closed their short positions.

Please excuse my bad English, I'm not a native speaker.
I am also absolutely no market expert, so if anything doesn't add up, feel free to correct me."

1618622890.0,58,"why you should be rock hard for $DIS, from a nerd","Alrighty retards, I've been here since late January and I am amazed at how little chatter there is about Disney right now.  There's 3 key things that make me super bullish about it, and I'm gonna try to break them down without any of that technical jargon that you need to be actually smart to understand. Disney+, Disney Parks, and their merchandise.

So! let's start with the easiest one to dive into:

# THE THEME PARKS: 

 In 2019, Disney parks generated 6.7 BILLIONS in income, a little over 40% of their entire revenue.  With the pandemic, park attendance obviously plummeted, and several closed.  At the time of writing this, only 3 of the 6 parks globally are open, with one (Disney California) set to re open by the end of the month with reduced capacity (around 25% of the max).  With Biden's plan to have everyone able to be vaccinated soon, that capacity is going to back up to max, and as the entire world recovers the other parks go back to normal too.  with every park going back up, there's gonna be a massive bump in income.  That's before you consider that most everyone has been locked up for over a year now, and I am willing to bet my left nut that somewhere some little timmy and billy have been begging their middle class mommy and daddy to go to Disney.  I wouldn't be surprised if we see record attendance numbers for these parks this year.   


But wait, there's more! There is an Avengers themed area set to open in June this year, and Galaxy's Edge, the Star Wars themed section of the American Parks, opened May 31, 2019  to  rave reviews!  Given the new Star Wars content being announced and published, attractions like these are going to continue to expand and draw people with new experiences.  You can build your own lightsaber there, for $200! and that ties into...  


# THE MERCHANDISE:

Disney sells a LOT of shit.  I mean, a fucking lot.  Star Wars alone has entire series of novels, comic books, video games, apparel, and even a convention (Star Wars Celebration) .  And since the Sequel trilogy has ended, Disney has moved Star Wars into a new era: The High Republic.  Primarily as books and comics, this era is 200 years before the mainline series.  They have CENTURIES of timeline to play with, and without the restraints of existing material to confine them.  The Clone Wars is only a roughly 3 year period in the lore, and the amount of shit that happens in that period is insane.  Disney is going to milk this period for as much as they can, with some speculation they may bring in some fan favorite characters from Star Wars Legends (canon before Disney bought the rights and erased 90% of the timeline), namely Darth Revan.  I won't get into it too much, but Revan alone is a huge draw for Star Wars Fanatics.  Marvel is also killing it with comic books and collectibles, but my knowledge is admittedly less in depth on the MCU stuff, merch wise.  The universe, though?

&#x200B;

# DISNEY+:

Disney+ is an absolute gold mine that Disney is sitting on.  They have exclusive access to two of the biggest IP's, period, with Star Wars and the MCU, and both are built on movies and tv shows.  With how the Netflix MCU shows have had the rights revoked, the onslaught of new shows (Wandavision, Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Clone Wars season 7, Bad Batch, The Mandalorian, Book of Boba Fett, Kenobi...) Disney is setting itself up to keep those subscriber numbers up by slow feeding the horde of fans with content.  Add in how they've been doing movie releases on the platform with Mulan, where you paid an additional $30 to access the brand new movie, and how that model has also been confirmed for the upcoming Black Widow and Cruella films, and it's a safe assumption that Disney is gearing the platform up to be a theatre alternative.  why go buy a movie ticket and drive to theater, deal with a noisy crowd, and not be able to pause the movie when you can just buy it from home and watch it? This is likely going to happen for the entire future of the MCU.  The big ace up the sleeve though, is the Fox library.  Remember that Disney bought out Fox not too long ago? They have nearly all Fox content now on Disney+.  X-men, Avatar (blue aliens, not the cartoon) Night at the Museum, etc are all Disney now.   


In short, Disney is STACKED to make a killing these next few years, but especially this year."

1618620361.0,14,Autonomous Trucking startup IPO that you didn’t hear about. Potential 10x. 🚀🚀🚀,"Alright retards, buckle up. Autonomous Trucking startup TuSimple IPO’ed this week April 15th 

$TSP shares are still trading around IPO price of $40.

Here is the story of TuSimple founded in San Diego in 2015 that already has partnerships with UPS, Xpress and McLane. Also did a trial run for USPS last year.

https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/21/self-driving-truck-startup-tusimple-will-haul-mail-for-usps-in-two-week-pilot/

From an article last year:

[https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/tusimple-kicks-off-plan-for-a-nationwide-self-driving-truck-network-with-partners-ups-xpress-and-mclane/](https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/tusimple-kicks-off-plan-for-a-nationwide-self-driving-truck-network-with-partners-ups-xpress-and-mclane/)

TuSimple already carries freight in its autonomous trucks (always with human safety operators on board) along seven different routes between Phoenix, Tucson, El Paso and Dallas. TuSimple said it will expand its service area with existing customers UPS and McLane. U.S. Xpress is a new partner. Penske will help TuSimple scale its fleet of operations nationwide and provide preventative maintenance for the self-driving trucks, the company said.

TuSimple said the network will be rolled out in three phases, starting with a focus on a service area in the Southwest where it already operates. Phase 1, which will launch in 2020 and into 2021, will cover service between Phoenix, Tucson, El Paso, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio.

This fall, TuSimple plans to open a new shipping terminal in Dallas. TuSimple said these terminals are designed to be shared by mid-sized customers. TuSimple will carry freight directly to a company’s distribution center if it is a high-volume customer.

The second phase will begin in 2022 and expand service from Los Angeles to Jacksonville and connect the East Coast with the West, the company said.

The final phase will expand across the lower 48 states, beginning in 2023. The company said it will replicate the strategy in Europe and Asia after the AFN rolls out nationwide.

Seems like a good follow through until Oct

[https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2020/10/29/tusimple-alliancetexas.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2020/10/29/tusimple-alliancetexas.html)

TuSimple, has amassed a workforce of about 800 and raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors. The company posted revenue of $1.8 million last year and a net loss of $177.9 million, according to the filing, reflecting how it is still in the early stages of developing commercial technology.

TuSimple has so far earned money as a traditional freight-hauler, not from selling its self-driving technology ready in 2024. It has customer reservations for more than 5,700 trucks, although those aren’t equivalent to sales revenue.

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/tusimple-ipo-filing-shows-self-driving-trucks-still-a-money-loser-11616535572](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tusimple-ipo-filing-shows-self-driving-trucks-still-a-money-loser-11616535572)

&#x200B;

When you bet on a comp this early, you need to look at the space and team.

Autonomous trucking space is red hot. Trucking by far happens on the interstate highways which are easiest to automate for Level 4 and 5.

Trucking by far is very lucrative to automate. Cost of goods carried. No long stops, more safety, machines are less susceptible to fatigue. The merits of automating trucking need another reddit post all by itself. 

Now let's look at the team:

Well, it does have a connection to ‘China’ but the founder seems legit.

TLDR: Real autonomous driving technology startup that seems legit. Potential to be a runner like $NKLA (but with real tech)

Cap is > $1B. Potential 10x. Could deploy tech massively either in the US and/or China. 

Team and tech could also attract a buyout from bigger players

1618618171.0,1449,I counted all the GME Yolos Part 3,"Hi Everyone,

In case you missed my first posts on my efforts of counting gme yolos they can be found here: [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdex64/dd_i_counted_all_the_wallstreetbets_gme_yolos/) [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/me13xm/dd_part_2_i_counted_all_the_wallstreetbets_gme/)

To summarize I am manually recording every instance of people posting their positions.  I have dedupped the data and interestingly the only instances of repeat users has been users increasing their positions. This could be because the type of the user to post their position is fully committed or if they do decrease their position they won't post. Either way pretty interesting. I am making some pretty stupid assumptions that of all the positions I have recorded no one has paper handed. Previously I had recorded 261 yolos holding 339,958 shares.

**Updated Data:** Since then I have recorded an additional 212 positions for a total of **473** positions representing **576,433** shares. With current after hours share prices of $160.81 these shares represent **$92,696,190.73** or for those that can't read big numbers **92.7 million**.

As I had mentioned in my previous posts I personally believe the [rule of 1%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_%28Internet_culture%29) on the internet applies to these yolo positions and for every position posted there are likely 10-100 that are silent. Just for fun if we apply the 1:9:90 ratio for content creator, upvoter  and viewer. We can make a some what irresponsible estimates of  silent whales :

1:9= 4,257 Silent WSB Kongs with 5,187,897 shares.

1:90= 42,570 Silent WSB Kongs with 51,878,970 shares.

Either way retail owns a lot and can make an big impact by holding.

**TDLR: Just 473 WSB Kongs hold 576,433 shares worth 92.7M**"

**What usually drives $XBI ?**

* **M&A** Premiums, only $XLV big large cap healthcare companies can really put a $ price tag on XBI and recently we have been having Great volume.
* Interest rates, $XBI companies mostly never generate cash flow in the short term, it is a promise of future cash flows far in the future and only if the something within the pipeline crosses the FDA approval process. Just like the Nasdaq thus.
* Regulatory challenges

The suits have started shorting this thing because they think Papi Biden gonna screw the industry to 0. These greedy pigs accumulated a short interest of ABOVE 100%. A lot of them are just here on momentum let's face it.

**This whole short started because there were rumors about the viability of the AZN / ALEXION deal well guess what, the relevant reg bodies just approved it today. I think XBI should jump 10% on this news**

**I have a whole lot of theories as to why it didn't today but suffice to say it will likely happen next week.**

In 2019, VW's [Electrify America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrify_America) and $CHPT agreed to provide common access to their US customers. Company reached 100,000 chargers in September 2019, while adding more than 2,000 charging locations per month. Currently $CHPT offers 132k charging station network. Which accounts for 72% market share of total level 2 charging in North America. New entity was formed from Legacy Charge Point combined with Switchback late Feb 2021;

**What is the business model of CHPT?**

Charge Point sells hardware & software (equipment & network subscriptions) to property owners. The company doesn't own the majority of stations. It doesn't monetize energy. It only monetizes the driver, thus capital light business model.

$CHPT enjoys the [largest share](https://investors.chargepoint.com/why-invest/default.aspx) of Level 2 chargers in the US. Data from [AFDC](https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/analyze?fuel=ELEC) shows that $CHPT wields the largest market share at 42.8K L2 chargers out of 92.8K total of which 11.5K are ""non-networked"", carving \~53% market share of ""networked"" chargers. No 2 competitor is Tesla with 16.8K, No3 largest, is SemaCharge Network at 5.2K, followed by Blink with 3.1k which is 4th. In terms of L3 'Superchargers', where Tesla leads the way with 10.7k of 19.6k units. $CHPT is competitive with 1.5k with only Electrify America coming in higher at 2.5k. Superchargers account for \~22% of the market pie, L2 \~75% and L1, \~3% of market share. People keep reiterating that L3 is the future and no one should bother with L1 & L2. Well, that's wrong. L3 is obviously the option for the highways, commercial and service transportation. Even larger segment though is found at: parking lots, restaurants, cinemas, sports arenas, malls, corporate offices and other mass conglomerations. This is where L2 comes to play much cheaper than L3 to install, but with longer charging times - perfect fit.

**Products**

Comprehensive Hardware Portfolio Delivers - Solutions for every use case, all vehicle types and brands - High efficiency in power and footprint - Modular, scalable, secure architecture designed for serviceability- Unparalleled quality; advanced testing (vehicle, functional, climate, environment) for long-term reliability - Options for site hosts to use custom branding

**Software Enables** \- Control of who can use stations and when - All vehicles to get charged on time - Multiple vehicles to share power - Drivers to get in line when ports are occupied- Roaming integrations with other charging networks

**Challengers**

* $VLTA; Claims to go beyond just charging EVs, their chargers are used for ads and their charger placement is based on data analytics in collaboration with $PLTR. When company compares itself to the competition, they do it all - they own the gear, they sell the electricity, they provide software and networks, they do fancy data things, they do advertising. The things they don't do, are manufacture and sell the chargers. They cherry-pick a bunch of stats to show that their chargers have better ""engagement"" but given they only have 1.7k Level 2s & 6 L3. It's like chargers-as-billboards, selected to prime locations. *Anyone can replicate it, if it provides substantial revenue boost, competitors will emulate it*.
* SemmaConnect: Company boasts 3rd largest market share of L2 chargers. SemmaConnect also manufactures chargers and sell software. SemaConnect chargers are OCPP compliant. Sema appears not to have a L3 offering, nor do they appear to offer sales to individuals (single-family residential).
* $EVGO; EVgo claims to have made the first 150kW and 350kW L3 chargers, and base their business largely on L3 chargers. AFDC data says they only have 403 L2s but 1.4k L3 which garners 4th market share. Company also offers drivers a membership for reduced charging rates (\~0.04/min assuming you spend 7.99/month) and they have integrated Tesla connectors on their newer L3. EVgo also has a nationwide infrastructure roll-out deal with GM and are entirely powered by renewables. What differentiates the company is the L3 focus.
* $BLNK: Overhyped POP stock. Blink sells L2 and L3 chargers to business and individuals. Claims to operate on an owner/operator model. From EC:*""The Company made continued progress with its owner/operator strategy; the number of commercial Blink-owned charging stations contracted or deployed during the quarter grew by 51% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period.""*
* $VWAGY Subsidiary:(Electrify America): L3 focused company, it enjoys 2.5k L3 chargers. EM also sells a L2 for the home. EM offers an app, membership for drivers with a monthly fee that gets you a good discount on their charging costs. The membership and cost to charge suggests that they own their chargers. EM also have an electric vehicle subscription service and have some relationships with Jeep and Hyundai. All its reports seem to be released to the California Air Resources Board. Company doesn't appear to build their own chargers, instead relying on procurement, using third-party hardware and software.

**Near Term Catalysts**

In relation to upcoming US government infrastructure bill: ""AlixPartners estimates $300 billion will be needed to build out a global charging network to accommodate the expected growth of EVs by 2030, including $50 billion in the U.S. alone.""

It's not too late to make bets on upcoming infrastructure bill. Yes you can dabble into construction firms and commodity plays, but you don't know which companies will win lucrative contracts and sizes of those contracts. Well the biggest companies you might say? It's not that clear cut. What is clear cut, is that the focal point of this infrastructure bill is transition to renewable energy and overhaul of pivotal infrastructure. $CHPT has the most experienced (14yrs) company with largest manufacturing capacity, technical know how and ability to take on large scale projects like, building hundreds of thousands of charging stations across all states (500k by 2030). Oh yeah one more thing, former $CHPT board member is in current administration.

That's only US. $CHPT operates infrastructure in the hub of world's renewable energy aka Europe. (Also, Canada, Australia, UK, Mexico among other places) You find yourself at the erection of the infrastructure that you and your kids will be utilizing down the road. Just like, railways, roads, telcoms and internet.

**Long Term Catalysts**

\- Fossil fuel bans - Transit electrification dates - Incentive programs - All major auto OEM brands committed to electric + Further EV cost reductions with advances in battery technology.

$CHPT Growth Directly Proportional to EV Penetration, $CHPT Estimated $1B Revenue at 3% EV Penetration.

**Miscellaneous**

$CHPT Apple Store rating: 4.6.

$CHPT also has the #1 bestselling home charging station on Amazon with hundreds of 5 star reviews.

$CHPT offers access to hundreds of thousands of places to charge with one account via proprietary app.

In collaborations with Daimler, Toyota, BMW, Siemens etc.

No1 choice for Fortune 500 companies. Customers include: Google, Target, IKEA, NASA, GM, Pepsico, Disney, McDonalds, FedEx, Stanford etc.

Shareholders lock up period ends on September 1st.

**MOAT**

* First Mover Advantage (With 14 years of experience in a nascent industry, this is where big contracts will go)
* Asset light business model ( Selective ownership of charge stations, outsources maintenance & responsibilities to the owner)
* Economies of Scale ( $CHPT has largest manufacturing capacity)
* Network Effect ( \~75% of charging network market share & operations in 14 countries)

**CONCLUSION**

All in all $CHPT stock is a pure EV exposure, with light CapEx business model. Company is the ecosystem player with defensible MOATs, recurring revenue streams and visibility. $CHPT finds itself in ESG friendly category and attracts premium valuation due to penetrance in multiple domains: EV Ecosystem (Hardware), Software Powered Solutions and Energy Technology.  Yes most of its network is L2 chargers, but it's where most of the money is to be made. As users go to restaurants, malls, sports events/concerts, office, cinema, universities or just a Parking Lot! There will be L2 charger not L3 due to: Charger Cost Basis/Time Parked. Pretty straightforward formula.

**Why am I interested in $CHPT?**

Because it's an entrenched leader with tremendous experience in a nascent industry.

Because it's a clever business model based on light assets which will subsequently offer high margins 5 years from now. And is literally replacement of GAS stations no matter what happens! And is a home ""GAS station"".

Because EVs are the future and I am catching the momentum and inevitable supremacy and prevalence of charging stations.

A small market cap in the market that will explode no matter what.

This is really well rounded company with superb fundamentals & \~13% institutional ownership, what's going to happen to the stock when institutions commence adoption of it? Let me use a technical term you''ll understand, the valuation will go - bananas.

1618597511.0,6,Marathon Oil - $MRO - Market Manipulation?,"Oil prices have been going up, but oil stocks have been dropping, some like MRO quite substantially. There doesn’t seem to be any reason for it, demand is increasing, production is steady, inventory is dropping, and economic data has been increasingly positive, with Covid downturns in Europe already priced in, and the US/travel beginning to open up.

While there are undoubtedly risks to oil itself dropping such as the OPEC+ production increases slated for may, it doesn’t make sense why oil prices would increase while oil stocks, which are almost solely dependent on oil prices, drop. 

I believe this coming week will see one of two things, a correction of crude oil prices themselves, or a massive gap up in oil stock prices.

A massive gap up to me makes more sense, as until may there are not many major sources of strife outside of a massive covid spike or rapid production increases from Russia/Iran (which is definitely possible but I don’t believe likely)

It seems that the prices may be pushed down in order to create a panic sell slide which would allow a better entry for larger positions for institutional investors. 

I’ve also seen several “prepaid forward contracts” vehicles that went into effect this week from Citigroup and UBS listing MRO as one of the underlying stocks, I’m wondering if they are driving prices down to hedge their bets so they could be in a better position when the interest payments for these contracts come around. Using the initial funds generated by the contracts to purchase cheaper shares and simply pay out comparatively smaller interest on them to their customers. They make money from the purchase of these forward contracts initially, and they make more from the purchase of cheaper shares that they are pocketing, rather than those who purchase the contracts.

For reference the Citigroup contract has three underlying assets: MRO, WYNN, and BA. All of which have dropped 1.5% or more this week despite better outlooks economically. 

The Citigroup filing is below, this is obviously all speculative, and I’m not trying to sound conspiratorial, but I truly don’t know what else it could be, what do you think?

Let me start with I am not a financial adviser, I am just a lowly engineer who likes numbers.

**MRNA**

Projected sales for 2021 $18 billion (from MRNA last Quarter)

Projected doses sold in 2021 600 million to 1 billion

Price per dose $32-$38 per dose depending on how many you buy.

Just using these numbers MRNA will gross $19 billon to $38 billion.  This gives us an EPS of $46-$96.  At its current price the P/E ratio would only be 1.5-3.5!!  I know I am not figuring in costs but they cant be that bad.  I would guess $2-3 billion to ramp up production?

Moderna reports earnings on the 5th of May, I expect this to be a total blowout from what I can see above.

So why is the price so low still?  I am guessing that the fear of something going wrong with the vaccine  is still priced in.  If something goes wrong it would be catastrophic but so far so good!  I have yet to see any zombie reports...

**Why I am investing heavily in MRNA:**

\-I believe in the company.  I am double vaccinated with Moderna and everyone I know that had it had very mild side effects.

\-I believe in the science of what they are doing with messenger RNA.

\-Booster shot sales in the future?  AIDS vaccine?  CURE FOR CANCER??

Am I missing something here?  Please let me know what you guys think."

1618591449.0,48,MSOS YOLO and DD - Why I'm betting on next week to change the game for cannabis in the United States,"# Trying to be the Prophet of Profit

There's been a great deal of talk, trading and speculation about the cannabis sector in the past few years. Over the past few years and more interestingly few months we're seeing a staggering increase in legalization of recreational cannabis in the united states at the state level.

More importantly keeping a close eye on the activity of the Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer there is a continuous promise of reform legislation being introduced ""soon"". Soon is a dangerous word and this is an invitation to time the market.

Normally don't ever try to time the market like this. I'm a big believer in leaps on principle. From a few key data points being vast increase in legalization legislation at the state level and the echoes from Schumer's twitter feed about the very soon incoming reform legislation I'm finally ready to make my bet.

If you've kept up on the posts of my sub(I will not mention the name of my sub because that's not the point. I just needed a place where I knew my posts would NOT BE REMOVED.) you'll see I'm pretty consistent about watching Schumer's moves and also the new state legislation. All the news is good news. I want to cover one data point that I haven't really mentioned in the past. Schumer in 2018 introduced the MORE act. It obviously didn't go anywhere with McConnel running the senate but this is a very different situation. It is my firm belief that Schumer will actually do what he says he's going to do. The interesting data point about MORE act in 2018 was that it was introduced on the most meme date: April 20th.

I think Schumer is going to be apart of the meme and reintroduce legislation on this day next week. I also expect to see more robust edition of the legislation that handles many of the concerns of both the right and the left with regards to gracefully transitioning to a legal cannabis market.

Schumer Wyden and Booker worked together to build something so I am concluding that it's extensive, robust and addresses concerns around the war on drugs and the effects on POC in the United States.

There are some concerns around risk of the vote passing and avoiding it going nowhere due to filibuster. After doing research on the senators on the right wing and also watching unexpected support for the SAFE act I am now convinced that the legislation will be passed in the Senate this year.

I have covered every concern I've had about cannabis in my past posts be it on my sub largely or on r/wallstreetbets. If you want to see some of my DD go look for it. I'm not cross posting or linking them.

# My Expectations

I expect the announcement on the 20th next week and a sharp price movement upward. The following day there may be a selloff as there are always scalpers to shake out the FOMO buyers. I expect the price to either stagnate or slowly rise until the legislation ultimately pass and then a sharp selloff of 10-20%. This will be the day traders / short term traders exiting for profit.

I think it's fair to expect at least a 25% increase in the price of MSOs and relevant ETFs that carry those holdings. (MSOS and some yolo holdings). Yes I'm speculating and no that isn't a math-derived number. MSOS currently sits at $40. It has taken hits over the past few months as pretty much the whole market.

I think the whole sector will jump but ultimately non multi state operators will see a brutal selloff depending on what's in the bill. My expectation with the legislation is that MSOs and smaller competitors will be the greatest beneficiaries. POC and people who want to enter the sector on a small retail end will be considered in the bill as they historically were a target of the war on drugs and will likely see special consideration in the bill.

Why?

Licensing isn't going away. This bill will not make a 'wild-west' scenario where anyone can enter the market. Licenses aren't free and aren't unlimited. Each state will control who has a license to interact in the sector. This isn't new and I'd be completely shocked to see any reversal of this trend. More so the states are ultimately going to be in control of all of the rules give or take a few federal stipulations.

# My Bet

If you've followed my posts you'll see I'm already very long on MSOS and the industry as a whole. I will get calls for either May or June and hold them for a bit. I will before the final vote is taken get some puts. I expect the sell off so I expect to ride it up by entering calls before announcement of the legislation and getting puts before the vote as I expect a selloff. This will also help me insulate my self from some of the risk of holding a completely one sided position.

I simply don't have enough money to exercise all of the calls I can buy so I will be selling a large portion of the short term ones after announcement. The strike on my long calls will be around c50 or c55.

# In short my play

* Buy calls before week ending 4/16 (expiry either May or June depending on risk and price)
* Sell calls after 4/20
* Buy puts before the final vote is taken in congress
* Close puts after vote confirms legalization
* Buy shares with any profits I've made

Here's my current positions as I don't know exactly when I'll enter my new calls. obviously I'm doing it today.

1618590150.0,1244,"Sup, apecitizens! I LOVE DOING some ANALysis occasionally, like many of you here. And I like memes, as much as I like the stock. Furthermore, WSB took important place in my life recently, so I decided to give back to the community, creating this comprehensive memeful ape-friendly GME DD 💎🙌🚀🌕🪐🌌","In the process of researching GME I was able to accumulate the material into this ape-friendly long read, largely aimed at newcomers of the sub. Though, this giant brain candy can and should be enjoyed by anybody!  
I have to warn you, apester, this is a super duper long read and it will take a considerable amount of your time as well as about 140% (several estimations state that the percentage might even be as high as 420-696.9%) of brain resources. However, it is completely worth it to read it in full, I promise you - ap~~e~~ transcendence is imminent upon completing the reading. Also, do it for the love to memes, because I genuinely handcrafted about 15 memes and put it here for your satisfaction.

My fundamental idea behind this colossal, voluminous piece of work was to build a framework for myself (and other interested apes), as to be aware of where it all stands now, how it all got here, and the likely outcomes of this spectacular show you have all been observing and participating in. Furthermore, I tried my best to make the language as simple as possible, using **ELIA**s (**E**explain **L**ike **I**'m an **A**pe) where possible, and doing my best in elaborating on difficult financial concepts and terms for this intellectually limited individuals with extraordinary small brain capacity that you all are. This work is structured in such a way so that even with zero knowledge in the subject, you will be able to grasp all of the important concepts from the first go. It is especially important for the newcomers of this sub, influx of whom might happen, should any major potential catalyst unwhale. So, do not hesitate to share this even with 1/10 brain-wrinkled individuums. I believe in your mental capabilities apemeisters (though, I know that at this point it is a pure gamble - and I am in the right place for that).

And yeah, this a not a financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor. Just and ape with one and a half brain wrinkles (hopefully).

**LR; TD (Long Read; To Do) by Master Yoda:**

https://preview.redd.it/nz4ujbu2ujt61.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e45b0bcd43bd5b0247f413b1978e7e246801c41

The story addressed is as old as this world, and it involves greed, manipulation, exploitation, corruption and decay; as well as unity, bravery (abreast retardation), optimism, support and and creative forces. The eternal battle of good and evil, no matter how corny it sounds. Compulsory buckle up and eat a crayon apefriend, that's going to be a ride!

# Chapter I. The Short, the Squeeze and the Ugly

The story begins with a hedge fund (HF from here on), and there is really nothing particular about this HF. For general understanding of an ape that knows nothing: ""A **hedge** **fund** is an investment partnership - the marriage of a fund manager and investors who pool their money together into the fund, with the objective of earning active return."" - The **game** is that simple, thanks, Inve **stop** edia, you are always spot on! The HF might have been named by whichever name exists, it really does not matter for history. What is actually important, is the setting in which it operated, and the rules, according to which this HF played (and also exploited). In this particular case, the antagonist is called Melvin Capital Management LP (MC thereafter). However, I would encourage you not to get attached to names; but instead view the antagonist as a collective image, as an intrusive parasite, which appears as soon as a suitable environment exists for that. And where there is one parasite, there will come many.

&#x200B;

**""ButT wat did di Hedgehogs do so that ther is sO mutch indiEgnation boUt t?""**

You are asking the right questions here, my little ape-man fellow. Only the lazy haven't scolded the HF, and as a matter of fact there are solid grounds to do so. Briefly, the antagonists exploited the loophole (do not confuse with the loop hole in your head, apemeister) in the short selling mechanism, which effectively allowed them to severely manipulate the market for their benefit. Furthermore, the bad guys have been doing that for years and even decades. GME is a very indicative, even whistleblowing example of the wrongdoing being done. All of these issues will be **D**ug **D**eeper into and discussed in detail further on, but let me start from the basics for half-wrinkled beginner apes to catch up with us, one whole wrinkle elitists.

**SHORT SELLING ELIA.** You are a smart entrepreneurial ape, and you obtained the information that led you to believe that the banana market will be aplenty this year (banana harvest go BBBRRRRR) and as a result the prices will drop significantly. The ape progress is so advanced, that you are able to enter a contractual relationship with another apedividual. This guy is known to have a big bulk of bananas just laying around, so you use this opportunity to borrow those for a period of time and agree to give those back later with the premium. The other ape sees you as a credible partner (understandable, as you went to Apeuke University and received MBA there - Master of Banana Appreciation degree)  thus lending you 100 bananas for one ape dollar each. You then rush to the local ape banana market 'ooh ooh ahh ahh'-ing all the way in great cheer for what a businessape apemomma raised. You sell the goods for $100 and wait. Because your due diligence was apegod-tier, the plan worked and one banana now costs 0.5 ape dollars. You then buy 100 banananas back from the market for $50 and give it back to the apelender, as well as a small premium agreed upon previously. ???? **PROFIT!!!!** (of about 50 bucks)

https://preview.redd.it/x0hwq95cujt61.png?width=503&format=png&auto=webp&s=353e830d77c215761c0b595610eac2e2e98a9c65

However, the example above only illustrates the perfect world, where all apes are honest apes and the ape market does not have inefficiencies. The current problem with short selling is that at one moment GME had the highest percentage of float shorted in the world, amounting to about 140% (and by many it is considered to be a rookie number, even currently). Yes, it does mean that more shares were sold short than shares existed. It is a big issue, let's discuss it in detail. One important point before we dive deeper, though. Lately I saw many honorable 'traders' ( ' ' marks mean that the word is used as an anagram) in comments criticizing the short mechanism as a whole, viewing it negatively and in some extreme examples even advocating the prohibition of it. And even though,

https://preview.redd.it/xt8bt34hujt61.png?width=488&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6506e88f0d417c5c62cde5ba20cd2c7ac39b170

, at this point it is important to mention that short selling is an integral part of the markets for a variety of reasons. In addition to creating liquidity to help make a market, short selling allows people to benefit from a stock price going down (as explained in the bananas ELIA above) leveling the playing field for those looking to make all types of investments. Short selling is an essential component of market stability (as long as it is not exploited, surely): hence sometimes longs are blinded by euphoria and optimism and there’s no one to hold these companies' feet to the fire, short sellers look at companies with a bit more of a critical eye than the average investor. Ooh, I'm starting to sound like a 🌈🐻, so forgive me permabullapes, as I have sinned, forgetting and ignoring the only autistic postulate to live by here, and that is: ""STONKS ONLY GO UP"".

&#x200B;

**""k Shortz IMPOrTENT but hoW iZ 140% bananana sell? Ape iNfinit maniy go BrrrRrr?""**

Yeah, you caught it right, smoothie-brainie. The main components to that are so-called IOUs, settlement cycles, leverage, excessive borrowing, failures to deliver, and, most importantly:

https://preview.redd.it/rgbvoyrlujt61.png?width=488&format=png&auto=webp&s=00239d43b35be1f158734b19e14fedb4be05bcf2

I am sorry that your head exploded after looking at the words aforementioned above, I really am! But this is how the evolution works, and you just fell victim to it. Nevermind, just collect the shattered pieces of your brain (about two grams, should not take long), put it back into the empty vessel that your head is, and fix it with some duct tape, I dunno. Jokes aside, let's continue, and now I will explain the cornerstone concepts of IOU obligations (abbreviation of I Owe You) as well as FTDs (failures to deliver), as these will be prevalent through the entire discussion. Starting from the basics first:

**IOUs ELIA**. Your ape grandma lived a busy life and she has a lot of ape-dollars as her savings. She heard about the banana price increase hype as everyone's been talking about it, so she decided to buy some for her own. Luckily, there is a decent broker called Bananality, and because she feels like really shaking the old days, she YOLOs all her savings into the bananas of BanaNonStop Corp. So far so good? 🐻 with me. As soon as apema pays for the banana stock, the money and the bananas have to change hands, and this is called 'settlement'. In many ape countries money and bananas change hands two days after the trade, and that is called 'T+2'. Ideally, this processes have to take place simultaneously. But in the current ape financial system bananas are divorced from money, thus her money may settle independently of  bananas settlement. Before the trade settles, ape grandma will be holding banana IOUs on her account, and importantly these are IOUs for BANANAS, not for money. Furthermore, the system sees her IOUs as normal stock bananas. In the perfect ape world, the blockage does clear up after T+2, and Bananality is able to send the banana stock through the system hence the IOUs are wiped out.

**Failures to Deliver (FTDs) ELIA**. Now let's imagine that apema was not so lucky in choosing her broker and ran into a crook, who wants to deliberately exploit the system of settlement and the broker is called Bananaked. The grandma enters the trade, the money settles, however, something blocks Bananaked from settling its shares through the system. And this something is nothing but a malicious intent, as all the the broker did was issuing banana IOU's with no real intention of covering it according to the rules. It might even be the case, that Bananaked never held those shares which he sold. If at the moment of T+2 settlement the IOUs are not covered by the banana stocks, it creates a deliberate, strategic failure to deliver. FTDs will be involved in the discussion later on, as these are the main vehicles through which the loophole is exploited (still, not as bad as your hole is exploited, though). Well, fuck you, Bananaked, the day will come and you will be dealt with for messing up with apema, mark my ape word!

Puts on your brain then. Just eat a banana, or a Crayon, you will be fine... Allrighty, you convinced me. Lets dive out of theory and discuss GAMEEESTOOOOP, finally! We will jump back to the concepts elaborated upon above as soon as the context is necessary for that. Here, Wen Moon got your back and he will cheer you up for your dedication to reading!

[\\""Camon ape ya can do it, read and evolve!\\"" - Wen Moon.](https://preview.redd.it/cboe9744vjt61.jpg?width=1059&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cffb0db75e9a238bd26bb7d36b2b78b509be34ec)

**""oKay i candO yit, fUkc mah braIn wit moore nowledge mtfakeRr!""** \- an ape.

That's the approach I needed. Remember about antagonistic MC? No, not the one who performed at your ape party last weekend and did it pretty bad. I'm talking about Melvin Capital. So, the main story line begins in 2014, the year when MC started to short the stock that I like very, very much. Gabe Plotkin, MC manager stated that fact proudly himself, during the first Congressional Hearing. There were several big fundamental reasons to bet on GME decline at that time, among which: company's debts and financial position, digitalization of the gaming industry, consoles sales \[big part of the revenue\] super-cycle moving away from its apex (and later on, the pandemic happened, which added dramatically to the negative sentiment). Let's take a look at the chart of GME:

[GME Monthly Chart, 2014-2019 highlighted](https://preview.redd.it/fr7lat7kvjt61.png?width=2129&format=png&auto=webp&s=b93e9ba2885b5093a8687aa249fdb2dce0bc5676)

As you may see, the chart covers a relatively long period of time, and the big red REKTangle here highlights the fat and nasty, steady downward trend. From the current outlook on things, it is obvious that MC made a correct financial decision, shorting the stock from its highs of about $45 a share, all the way down to about 3-6 dollars per share diapason starting in the middle of 2019. That is a whooping gain of more than ninety(90)!!! %, or more than forty dollars per share gain! Impressive numbers, aren't they? Yeah, you won: you were right betting against the company; you've made shit tons of money; your wife's boyfriend accepted your dominance as an alpha 'trader' (anagram) ape and voluntarily left the family, now FIX YOUR FUCKING PROFITS AND CLOSE YOUR POSITION! Why did the shorters not cover when they had a perfect opportunity window for that LASTING FOR MORE THAN A FUCKING YEAR? Because of the bankruptcy jackpot.

As it was explained previously short selling is an important market instrument and it may deliver net decent profits for investors who thoroughly calibrate the risk; the 'bankruptcy jackpot' is a relatively uncommon situation which promises a much larger pay off should it occur. And it is an extremely risky bet, the one that only the epic 'traders' are willing to undertake (so, to some extent it is possible to say, that MC belongs to WSB). The HFs were driven by the fact, that in the event of insolvency, any collateral provided to back up the shorted shares has to be returned to the short seller. Furthermore, as it is no longer necessary to return the shares shorted, the shortist takes it all, the whole profit. As soon as the it became obvious for HFs that the copany should soon go buncrupt, the MHFs decided to 'help' Gamestop and invoked their dirty trick of naked short selling to the full power (the mechanism is discussed below). Before the Ryan Cohen updates, the consensus and the market sentiment on the greatest stock of all time was severely grim. So, why not go all in if you had already won it all (HF reasoning)?

They dared to YOLO, 140% or more type of YOLO...

And soon the shitshow of an unimaginable scale begins to uncover itself. But before that...

&#x200B;

**""WatT hapenT nExt telL meh rn ya cheeKY wahnKerR!1? How dit dey YOYO?""**

Everything has its time, young padawan, don't hurry. The second half of 2020 brought several substantial catalysts for the dramatic shift of GME consensus towards being positive, accordingly, pushing the price of the stock to the upside. And to a great extent it has to be attributed to one fellow, and you all know his name. Yes, apeladies and gentleapes, this is your hero and savior, <in Leeroy's Jenkins voice> RYYYYYAAAAANN COOOOHEEEN. If by now you do not know this guy, then you can't really call yourself an ape, things don't work like that here, go and duckduckgo him or something!

By buying a big stake of GME \[12.91% currently\], RC (and his Ventures) brought a lot of attention to the company, giving the market sentiment a powerful bullish impulse, and then accelerating it even further by getting deeper involved into the business operation and the development of GameStop. At this point, it is fair to say, that many of the pioneering bulls were jumping into the market buying rumors.

[Many, but not u\/DeepFuckingValue of course. This guy is out of this world.](https://preview.redd.it/v7m84mkqwjt61.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5bbbf5afcba1ec73751912ce860f7bc397ee640)

It is with the new updates that were being poured out of the bucket, the investors, ‘traders’ and general market participants found out that: GameStop is underway towards its digital transformation (online sales increased in 300% Q3 2020); internal restructuring bound to the new growth strategy, resulting in CFO replacement; new consoles supercycle starting with PS5 and XBox Series X/S releases (historically very strong periods for *GME*), and many, many more under the hood developments of which we are not even aware of, or only start to find out about (just type the word 'delivery' into the search of a friendly *sub*). To conclude on that point:

https://preview.redd.it/bm94jyf0xjt61.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ec245cad38eb6d05c47ee5d168e5e498c45840a

When a general market sentiment changes from negative to positive, it is usually a bad idea to bet against it. Even WSB 'traders' understand this fundamental principle (correct me if I'm wrong), and this is where you, honorable 'Trader' with capital later, started to outplay the 'Big Guys'. Literally, the  🌈🐻 HFs fell victim to their own relentless greed and stupidity, forgetting the golden trading rule that the trend is your friend until the end, and they did it spectacularly. Furthermore, instead of closing the positions and cutting the losses, they kept YOLOing and shorted more and more, in an attempt to suppress the buying pressure. And literally, now all that it takes you to show an awesome 'tradering' performance this year, is to buy, and hold.

**Short Squeeze ELIA**. Finally, it is time to discuss the most juicy squeezey piece of the puzzle. Let's refer to the short selling ELIA now. Remember how the businessape from the first ELIA happily brought the bananas to the ape market and in anticipation of the prices falling, sold his borrowed banana stock. Now, imagine that the forecast was not justified, and the things went according to the worst scenario possible: the banana harvest was poor and these became scarce; having bananas is now fashionable, and every ape wants to put their hands on what's hot; poor harvest, but because of abundant sunlight the bananas left are very delicious, so apes are ready to fight for putting it in their mouths... and etc. The businessape rushes around, panicking, begging for bananas, but these are nowhere to be found, because apemeisters hodl precious with their diamond ape hands; or, are only willing to sell 1-2 bananas for a ridiculous price of 500.000-1.000.000 ape dollars. The businessape now understands how screwed he is. He also recalls that the ape-guy he borrowed bananas from is an apemafiozi with a very bad reputation, because of punishing his failed debtors by putting LARGE bananas into their ANALysis. Fiasco, isn't it? The businessape now has nothing left to do, but to buy the banans back with any price available. Fortunately, the fortune he earned through decades of successful business is sufficient for covering his debts. And if not, you better recapitalize, ape pal, before bananas play a cruel joke on your ANALysis.

Apemeister! Don't hesitate to pause the reading and eat a Crayon if you need to. I know, that's a lot to digest, so take a proper care of your brain, currently working on 69420% of its capacity. Ready? Finally, this is the part where everything discussed above converges to one point. Quick ape recap: market sentimet bad, GME shortz short go BBBRRRR, Ryan Cohen buys GME to make it likable, market sentiment good, shortz r fuk, GME go BBBRRRR.

Oh, I see you are coming back to your natural state of an ape 'trader' again. I started to worry about you evolving too fast, now we're back to normal. 🐻 with me, this is the most interesting part.

https://preview.redd.it/gnxvi3bgxjt61.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=86b3a89e5c245e5ba1a22fb09df4ac9cbb120dd7

Remember IOUs, FTDs, HFs' YOLO 140% SI? Pepperidge apes remember. Ok, so, basicly short interest is a number that indicates the proportion of the shares in circulation (also called a float) sold short. Based on the businessape example, it would mean that he borrowed 100 out of 100 bananas available to being borrowed, went to the ape market and sold 140 bananas. Dafaq? How is that even possible? This is a complicated process, which I aim to discuss with a very in-**D**epth **D**ive, but in a separate post, Chapter II (as this post is voluminous enough already), alongside with dark pools, payment for order flow, sales restrictions, and other fuckeries for that matter.

For now, take a look at the following, and refer back to IOUs and FTDs ELIAs if necessary. According to T+2 settelment, the share has to be setteled no letter than two working days after the trade has been made. Before the settlement, what you hold on your 'tradering' account is an obligation for this share that you just bought - IOU. On a properly functioning market and not being exploited, T+2 has its positive effects too, providing additional liquidity to the system. However, when we talk about short selling, its effects can be destructive. Particularly, the loophole is used as an instrument to leverage the short position, without providing the adequate collateral in the short selling process which has to be, well you guessed, a share! And this process is being made three times cheaper for big players, as market makers operate based on T+6 settlement rule. That is to say, T+X makes it possible to back up your short position and create additional, artificial selling pressure by using IOUs which, in the nature of this mechanism, work as counterfeit collateral, and in its essence being nothing but

https://preview.redd.it/05e17wklxjt61.png?width=485&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b19d340a5a2d1f6ebd7af4da14cc9e953fad2ae

Furthermore, if you overuse or even overabuse this mechanism (to 140% and more), you may find yourself in a very unfortunate situation, similarly, to the one that MC and shorters found themselves in. Literally, by repeating this process over and over again, they put themselves into the trap, resulting in an inability to cover the excessive amount of shares borrowed, breeding FTDs in an futile attempt to fight the buying pressure. The key point to be made here is that it is often more profitable for big market participants to pay a fine, rather than letting the FTD game get loose, because the rules and laws in this area are not strict enough. Then, when nobody looks at the problem, well, the problem goes away. Сounterfeit IOUs morphing into FTDs allow shorters to manipulate the market by artificially decomposing the buying pressure, but as it is a double edged sword - there is a high chance that the accumulated compression will fucking blow in your face at the inevitable moment. Once, ONCE in the history of 'traderation', the 'BIG MONEY' YOLOd against you, respectable 'trader', and they fucking lost spectacularly. When it is obious for everybody that you lost, it is probably a good idea to cut your loses and close the positions. Can you see the beauty of their YOLO? It is almoast as good as GUH (if you don't know what it means, YT it urgently - GUH WSB!). The artificial selling pressure that is accumulating into a ticking atomic bomb is just crazy, and oh boy, would I not want to be on that side of the trade now, getting my ass torn apart by this blast, as soon as it is no longer possible to constrain it.

Furthermore, and most importantly, if they can use these pesky techniques now, how do you know that they did not use that in 2014, when the initail GME mega downtrand was born? With the media being used as a manipulation instrument currently, it might have also been used as a tool to formulate the negative outlook on Gamestop starting from 2014 too... That is just crazy and mindblowing, isn't it?

More than that, many new fuckeries were revealed: RobbingHood trade restrictions, cheating with ETF's and calls, short attacks, you know the list. This is utterly unfair, so the only available option for me in this delicate situation everybody found themselves in, was to buy and hold, because I like the stock. The end. Or is it?

They're really more of a product than a company. (yeah, I know about the EndoWrist shit, but that's hardly a revenue generator)  They make the Da  Vinci robot surgeon that you see in hospitals so long as you live in a nicer, more gentrified part of town.  Or work for one of the Colombian drug cartels - those dudes have the best medics.  If you've never heard of it, it's basically a Swiss army knife of attachments that will cut your ass open, fix what it can (sorry, that extra chromosome has to stay), and stitch you back up, all while your surgeon deals with his raging hangover and wonders what happened after he blacked out to where his ass is really sore this morning and the security guard out in the parking lot can't stop smiling at him.  That's it.  That's all they do.  Blah blah blah proprietary software blah blah blah expensive maintenance contracts blah blah blah each attachment for the robot costs money so hopefully your hospital sprang for the clip applier attachment before they snipped that pulmonary vein.  Fingers crossed.

Also, it apparently makes pancakes. :

# Deep dive:  This won't hurt a bit, except for the parts where it's excruciatingly bad.

&#x200B;

$ISRG is a 95 billion dollar company that sells about 1200 ~~Treadwell Droids~~  surgical robots a year at 2 million dollars a pop, and has come up with a great scam where some of the attachments are disposable so you have to keep buying them.  God bless America.  They make about a billion a year licensing out their software for use to mitigate the fact that your doctor can't remember which cord goes into which hole, and another 700 million or so on maintenance contracts to reboot the things when they accidentally kill somebody.   They make about 4 billion dollars annually, give or take.  For a company that lives and dies by its R&D, it surprisingly has no debt on the books.  It just makes more shares when they need money.   This also might have something to do with the fact that they haven't really improved on the thing in 20 years because nobody is forcing them to innovate.   They're trading near their ATH, at 804.72 as of the time of this writing.   The biggest fundamental thing to note about this company is that they basically have no competitors.  There is a company out there called (name redacted because of automoddy)  that made a run at the king, but fell so short that they changed their name from (name redacted because of automoddy) Surgical.  It's not that their robot - the Senhance - was bad, per se, it was just that it turned out it was only good for laparoscopics, which is fairly niche.  For the record, I like that company, but we can't talk about them here.

&#x200B;

One thing I've always hated about this company but have held my nose and overlooked was that it's PB ratio is way out of whack for its space.  The average company in the medical equipment industry averages about 5.1 PB.  $ISRG sits at 9.7.  Their PEG also sits at 6.5, which is fucking crazy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Cool.  So how much growth for buying in to the fucking robot army?

&#x200B;

Actually....none.  They made 2.64 a share a year ago, but the whispers on the street - and by street, I mean company executives - are to expect a down quarter this time around due to a combination of less hospital revenue as a result of leaving so much open bed space for the spicy flu and lower demand for elective surgical procedures - and, of course, by lower demand, I mean people being told they can't have them because there's a risk of catching a bug that you'll probably never even know you caught.  $ISRG had been rising recently on the ASSUMPTION that hospitals were going to open back up to more high margin things like elective procedures and away from things like ""leaving half the hospital empty in case 3 people catch the 'Rona"".  However, through the 1st quarter of the year, that has not happened, which means the backlog of surgical procedures just continues to grow.  Ambulatory surgery centers throughout a good chunk of the country still haven't converted away from triage facilities yet or are closing down surgical theatres periodically to reallocate staff, and there's no real word on when that is going to get rectified.

&#x200B;

Analysts have already been adjusting their expectations for the quarter downwards in the last month.  Expectations are now a 4% drop in earnings on flat-to-slightly-up overall revenues.  $ISRG has a habit of beating on earnings pretty much always, but they've reached such a lofty valuation that swapping out Tyson Fury for a Tyson chicken and then bragging you kicked its ass probably isn't going to be that impressive.

&#x200B;

The thing to note is that it's tested prices in the $81x's 3 times now (let's call it 810, because that's really where liquidity always starts to dry up), and has been rejected all three times.  And it's sitting pretty damn close to that again.  Also, every time it's tested resistance and failed, it's dropped to at least the mid 700's, usually crossing into the 6's briefly, which presently serves as strong support.  It's presently trading near its ATH's not because of anything it's done, but rather because lately the trend has been to rotate into big growth companies again, forgetting that small and mid cap plays exist.  That's all well and good, but one off quarter and you're no longer contributing to the artificial inflation of the $SPY.  This has been a  reliable quiet swing trader for me, but it's now at a crucial pivot point that's going to require a strong catalyst to continue any upwards momentum.  That's bad news for a company reporting earnings in a time when even Wall Street darlings sell off even on great quarters.  At the very least, this is a rally that is quickly running out of gas, as evidenced by reduced volume.  With them reporting next week on the 20th, the pivot point of reckoning is upon us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# My logic is undeniable (or, to summarize):

&#x200B;

* For the 2nd time in a row, an S&P 500 company that operates on the fringes of traditional growth
* Has positively ripped during this rotation from value into growth, in spite of all signals showing a down quarter and poor forward guidance as we are still in a period of Covidic uncertainty and what it means for the operating theatre
* Has no known competitors, which has not pushed them to expand into other revenue channels besides crazy expensive machines meant to cover up for how few decent doctors are entering the workforce anymore
* Is trading at a crucial resistance point that has been rejected forcefully 2 times in the past, with reduced volume each time
* IV on calls is quite pricey, but puts are dirt cheap
* If you really want dad's house, maybe make sure the ambulance sends him to Watts instead of Malibu.  Remember, if he ends up surviving the procedure, he's going to rat you out to the cops

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Price Targets:

&#x200B;

I'm expecting a miss when they report earnings next week, or at the very least a very muted guidance.  As such, I would not be surprised to see this stonk slip all the way down into the 720-740 range before it regains some footing.  Barring some sort of catalyst, I'm having a hard time seeing how this is going to get over that 820 hump any time in the near future.

&#x200B;

# How to play it.  That, detective, is the right question:

&#x200B;

All the technical signs and oscillators are pointing to it becoming a very top heavy trade, which means it's primed for a much bigger negative breakout on the slightest weakness.    All that said, I certainly wouldn't go bear on it long-term.  $ISRG has never been one of the most violent movers, but it has a way of defying the odds, and has displayed that ability in the face of adversity for decades now.  I think if they miss next week and the stock goes into a freefall, be prepared to be nimble and cash out the put and switch back to long, even if it's not necessarily justified.

&#x200B;

# An edit:

If you don't like the short action because of liquidity (a very valid item if you're interested in more than a handful of contracts), skip that part of it and set an alarm to go long at 725-ish.  You'll be happy with that one, too.

I'm pretty sure I own more than a few shares of this in my managed asset portfolios and, even though my short-term outlook is bearish, am also fairly certain my fund managers aren't going to want to create a taxable event with them.  **I am just flat-out short on the stock itself, but my appetite for potentially unlimited risk is different, and I can't say anybody else should do that.**  I'm holding 4/30 780 puts that I picked up for 10-ish bucks, as well as 5/28 $800p's.  I recently sold off my 7/16 795c's for a tidy profit.   Were I less of a pussy, I'd probably buy some 4/23 780p FD's.  Actually, I might do that for fun, anyways.  But remember, I'm gambling on a selloff on weakness.  If those further out puts print, I will cover them within a week or earnings and look for a consolidation pattern (probably a week or two later) to reverse course and buy some calls for another swing up.

&#x200B;

**Word of caution:**  Buying puts on a mega tech in this environment is an inherently risky move because big money has been rotating into it for weeks now.    This is not a bet-the-house scenario.  I have about a 70% conviction this is gonna go my way, but that other 30% is pretty ugly and basically guarantees a complete loss.  And even if you do play this along with me and it prints, don't sit there and try to milk it for too long.  Some hedge fund could decide it's oversold at 735 and eat away at your tendies.  Fuck that guy.  And then go buy one of these, because fucking him is legally perilous and he might fight back - the robot will never say no.

1618572930.0,31,Norwegian Air Shuttle,"Hi All

Been a lurker for while, after the whole GME scene I have been looking at stocks myself lately and wanted some feed back on Norwegian Air Shuttle (NAS). Its a low budge carrier and has been through a bad patch with mismanagement.

But all that has changed recently with a management restructure, see link below.

https://travelweekly.co.uk/news/air/ex-ryanair-director-lands-new-role-at-norwegian-air

Also a restructure plan allowed by the Irish courts.

https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/norwegian-air-wins-court-approval-for-restructuring-40244734.html

This could lead to a huge share prise rise, however I was hoping for some feed back from the experts on Redditt. Any feed back would be much appreciated.

Other transport based shares like Rolls Royce and IAG have seen their share price fall over Covid. My guess all will see a rise in share prices once lock down is lifted across the European continent.

1618561474.0,388,AMC are playing both the short and the long term game and praise the retal investors.,"Duh, not a financial advisor.

I loved every word of the interview with Adam Aron. He seems to be watching the market volume closely and plan his actions accordingly.

Quote from the article:

*""the movie-theater chain is once again “under attack” from short sellers after skirting bankruptcy during the Covid-19 pandemic.*  *The volume of short sales — bets that the stock will go down — rose about 50% in March to 73.8 million shares* *""*

Now, I'm not a market guru but I still believe that AMC are severely undervalued and heavily shorted. Yes, they've accumulated some debt but so have others and they survived through the worst of the pandemic one way or another, which means that the only way to go is UP.

If anything, they are on route to become winners after the pandemic since the ArcLight Cinemas and Pacific theatres have announced plans to close permanently.

*""Other theaters have succumbed to the Covid-19-struggle. ArcLight Cinemas and Pacific Theatres, two jointly owned California movie-theater chains, announced plans this week to close permanently, underscoring the still-tenuous state of the industry.""* 

The heavily discussed topic about the announcement to vote for the right to sell 500 million shares, which lead to significant price drop and short selling activity, has also been discussed by Adam Aron. The response:

*""If investors at the May 4 annual meeting approve the plan for additional stock, he’ll gain flexibility to buy back debt at a discount or acquire another chain at an attractive price, which would counteract any dilution.""*

And more importantly:

*""Aron, who has long been known as outspoken, also praised the internet investors who see themselves as fighting against “conventional” market participants, like short sellers who profit when stock prices decline. He connected with Collins, who offers online investment commentary under the username Trey’s Trades, after his 30-year-old son saw a tweet that Collins had sent to his nearly 50,000 followers, known as “apes.”*

*“My hat’s off to you,” Aron said. “I’m well aware that you have been talking about AMC a lot over the last few months and you have, you know, hundreds of thousands of subscribers, tens and tens of thousands of people watching your shows on the YouTube channel,” Aron said.*

*“I actually work for you,” he said, “and for that reason it’s a special reason for me to engage with all of you.”*

Read the last paragraph again. He works for us. So is every CEO on this goddamn planet that you guys have stocks in and hold long term. But he is the one who publicly acknowledged it. 

In summary:

1. Adam Aron acknowledged the rising activity in short selling which influences the price. 
2. He acknowledges the debt so he is acting accordingly.
3. Competition (at least on the west coast) reduced.
4. He works for the ""apes"".
5. No plans to immediately sell the 500 million shares they announced. If things get tough, they have the right to sell 43 million shares to cover debt which means bankruptcy is NOT on the cards.

It was a tough year for the theatre giant but CEO Adam Aron believes in a bright future. It was a one in a generation economic and health crisis but AMC survived. The only way to go is UP.

P.S. Don't take this as a guarantee. Like many others here, It is my personal DD, not a financial advise. Stay safe. Link: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-rises-ceo-clarifies-154113824.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-rises-ceo-clarifies-154113824.html)"
1618549012.0,564,Tech Industry Stock Compensation or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Insider Selling (PLTR),"**EDIT: TL;DR - everyone I see talking about stock compensation in tech (especially companies just coming public) or insider selling around earnings/tax season seems to have an incredible lack of context for how compensation works in Silicon Valley tech. I'm here to give you an insider perspective.**

I posted this in the PLTR sub in response to a lot of threads I saw about insider selling and complaints about stock compensation models in tech companies. Figured I'd also post it here for anyone interested in my take (as a tech worker) on these things.

Okay the title is somewhat misleading because I don't necessarily **love** insider selling, but I've seen a lot of posts here and elsewhere especially on insider selling and I've found there's a misconception of stock-based compensation and selling by insiders. To preface, I am a software engineer for a large cap tech company and this is my take on stock-based compensation in the tech world and some basic things that I think all people should be aware of when it comes to this compensation and the insider selling that accompanies it.

To start I'll give a little background on the way stock compensation works for people on the ground. The grunts like me who do the normal day-to-day boring coding that enables the apps and products you use. I'll be using mostly the FAANG companies as examples of established public companies and the kind of compensation you see there.

&#x200B;

**First things first: how does stock compensation work for most of these people?**

At most of these companies stock compensation is typically most heavy in the technical organizations of the company. That is to say, engineers are being compensated primarily in equity in the company in raw dollar terms, in some cases well over 50% of their yearly income. ***This difference is usually most prevalent in the first four years of employment.***

Why is that last sentence true? Because your initial grant of equity is typically one of the largest in order to ""get you in the door."" The cliff, as tech workers call it, at four years is the time at which an engineer will typically experience a net decrease in their overall income due to the fact that one of the largest grants they received expires at this time and their refresher grants are not as sizeable in dollar terms (excepting the most outstanding performers and the most rapid promotions, but these are very rare).

As a matter of fact, it's a well-known and oft-used strategy to bail from a company after your four year cliff and move to another or SIMPLY REAPPLY TO THE SAME COMPANY FOR ANOTHER INITIAL GRANT. Yes, this happens. I know people personally who have done it. You could call it mercenary behavior.

Personally, my total compensation every year is comprised of approximately 51% equity, 6.5% bonus, and the remaining 42.5% in salary (accounting for the current share price). And here's the important note about that: ***I am not by any means a stellar performer at the company***. I am at a senior level and meeting expectations well for my job and role but I am not in the upper bands of the most highly compensated individuals as a result of either stellar or lucky performance. I am well past my 4 year cliff though it doesn't matter, because I didn't begin my career as an engineer, which actually cost me a lot of money transferring to engineering. Remember those initial grants engineers get? Transfers don't get those. Point being: I am a decent engineer doing good work and my compensation is still driven mostly by equity. If I were getting much higher ratings, the percentage of my compensation driven by equity would be substantially larger.

Everything you've just read is pretty industry standard for these large caps as mentioned.

&#x200B;

**Why is this such standard behavior in many companies?**

Isn't the answer obvious? If most of your highly lauded compensation is in stock you are driven to help your company succeed. And depending on your equity grant type maybe even more so.

Remember above how I said that the yearly equity I receive is currently 51% of my total compensation. That's because the share price is where it is. If tomorrow the share price drops by 50%... well that would be bad. You know what would make it worse? The fact that the other load of stock I have in the company isn't vested and just dropped SIGNIFICANTLY in value and depending on what triggered the drop could be heading towards zero.

That's because the company doesn't hire you and just hand you a fat stack of stock. You vest a portion of it over time, regularly. Industry standard for many of these companies is now that you vest a grant over 4 years at 1/16th each quarter. So for me, right around earnings season I get 1/16th of each grant I've received for the previous 4 years. The point of this is clearly to keep me invested and to keep me driving for my own success by advocating for and working on the best things for the business.

&#x200B;

**What kind of stock grants are there?**

There are lots. But I'll quickly go over the one that people like Alex Karp deal with (joining a company well before going public) and the one I'm most familiar with: RSUs.

With RSUs, it's a pretty simple thing: the company will give you stock every quarter!

Okay so it's not quite this simple but close, and most importantly this is a taxable event - I'll talk about this next. The company hands you a cash bonus (basically) to buy the stock at the current market price and then you exercise that to buy the stock. Awesome! Except... you just got more income... and you have now locked all that money up in shares of your company. Uncle Sam would like a word with you about this.

With people like Alex Karp the situation is even more interesting: they are given options to the stock in the company. What does that mean? Exactly what you think it does. They are issued long call options with expirations and strikes against the stock. Alex Karp is in this situation now - he has over 60m options expiring that give him the ability to buy Palantir shares at the strike. However, the current price of the shares is well above his strike and the company is giving him compensation in the form of allowing him to buy the shares at their market rate for his strike. Uncle Sam would now like a word with Mr. Karp.

&#x200B;

**So how do these taxes work?**

My company uses a sell to cover model. What does this mean? When I am issued shares my company will simply sell some of those shares after they are purchased in order to send the proceeds to the IRS. What this value represents is the expected value of the tax I would pay on the bonus I was granted to purchase the shares at the current market rate. Basically, I would sell 35% of my shares instantly to cover the expected 35% tax I would owe on the bonus I was granted to purchase the shares. This is pretty straightforward and for someone like me doesn't even really register as insider selling because it's not large enough in quantity and I'm not C suite or any of that. But this is a form of insider selling that is automatic to cover taxes. Read this if you want: [https://thefinancebuff.com/rsu-sell-to-cover-deconstructed.html](https://thefinancebuff.com/rsu-sell-to-cover-deconstructed.html)

With options it's a bit different because the income to purchase the stock (the bonus) would be the difference between the strike price of the calls given to the employee and the current price of the stock. So Alex Karp's over 60m shares are currently valued at well over a billion dollars. But that means the relative income that the company provided to cover his stock purchase is almost the entire value of the stock (his strikes are really low). Now he has a FUCK ALL MASSIVE TAX BILL on the income he was granted to purchase the stocks.

So when he exercises these options and then you read about him selling a few million shares, remember this - he is obligated to pay a 37% tax on the income granted to him to purchase those shares that he can either pay with his own money, selling a portion of his grant, or offsetting in some other way.

&#x200B;

**These grants given to employees are not just brand new shares**

I've seen a bit of confusion about stock compensation specifically here so I'm going keep it short on this point - this sort of compensation is not just NEW SHARES FOR EVERY NEW GRANT!@!@!!!@@ That's not how it works. Dilution and new share issuance is a thing - but it's not the norm. If you're asking why they keep giving stock to people to work for them and that's why you think the price is dipping on things re-read this portion.

&#x200B;

**Insider selling is predictable**

Why is this? Most of these people are using 10b5 plans to schedule their stock sales. Insiders are locked out of trading their own stock or even related derivatives the vast majority of the time. That includes grunts like me. Most stock sales that I conduct are for reinvestment purposes and taxes (these are automatic). But the common trait is they all happen after earnings because that's when our lockup period expires and we are granted our new shares. That's why you see people like Zuckerberg, Thiel, Pichai, Bezos, etc. selling at the same time all the time or as a result of a scheduled release. Think of a 10b5 as dollar cost averaging but for the sell side.

&#x200B;

**Parting thought**

One of the main reasons I don't freak out when I see insider selling like we've seen here (unless it's dickhead Chamath and his SPACs which I won't touch because fuck that toolbox) is that I see this sort of sell-off all the time and because I understand a bit of the problem space Palantir is in. I actually used to work on the problem that got them to start this company while they were at PayPal: payments fraud. I also know that the industry really, really doesn't know how to handle problems like this as effectively as they think and that there are untapped places where software like this would be invaluable. Even in my own work, I can think of almost a half dozen places where this would be directly relevant to MY role in a large cap. I can only imagine the value if it were company wide.

***Also, you guys know how I look at companies that try to recruit or poach me if they're not public companies?*** When I get messages from these series A and series B folks or stealth startups I almost always go in to look at what their growth potential is. I look at it as though I'm trying to do a value investment. What is their TAM? What will it be next year? What is their current valuation? How has it changed in their funding rounds? What sort of people work there and would I expect to build an amazing company with a ton of deep value with people like that? How do their finances and board structure look to me? Is this going to be attractive to other investors? Is the product they are offering going to be the best? Can I make it that?

What do all those questions boil down to: ***WHERE THE FUCK IS THEIR STOCK GOING?!***

Because here's the thing, most grunts like me who leave our cushy large cap jobs for places like this are doing so knowing full well that we are taking a pay cut. What are we looking for? To create the deep value that is going to drive that stock value way up and offer the best product so that the paper money we are promised to get in the door turns into some real money. What drives us to make it better? Knowing that we have more paper money left on the table that we also want to be worth something. That and most of us leave jobs for paper money for problems we love. Problems we think about at night. Problems that we think will change something drastically."
1618548474.0,27,Rite Aid ( RAD ) Got Slaughtered When Earnings Were Released - Was It Warranted,"OK, OK, OK --- I know that Rite Aid had a bad Q4 due to the spike in COVID-19 infections that kept a large portion of the nation on lockdown, the reported weather and logistics issues, and most of all the weak cold and flu season (--Hey, everyone stayed home and wore a mask when out, so no one got sick with the cold or flu).  OK, Q4 is now in the rearview mirror, and the stock is trading below $18 per share.  Is that price warranted?  Some points to consider:

1) The market cap of the stock is now right around one billion dollars.  Does that sound reasonable for a company with $24 billion in annual revenue, positive cash flow, and $8 per share in adjusted EBITDA (during a COVID-19 stressed year, no less)?

2) The company provided guidance for the new / current Q1 of their 2022 fiscal year and indicated a break-even result +/- $10 million.  This represents a net earnings improvement of $63 to $83 million versus the prior year.

3) RAD management indicated they had administered 2 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine during the first six weeks of the new / current fiscal year.  Through the first half of the year, it appears 6 million doses will likely be delivered by Rite Aid.  This will result in $210 million in incremental revenue and $2 per share to net earnings.   Also, Pfizer's CEO mentioned today (April 15, 2021) that a third booster coronavirus shot will likely be required and that we should expect the COVID-19 vaccine to be administered annually like the flu shot.

4) The short attacks on the stock have ramped up this month leading into the earnings announcement.  On March 31, 2021 the short interest was 15.1%.  Not the highest we've ever seen, not by a long shot.  However, shorts are becoming more agressive in recent days:

* April 15th - 1,571,592 shares shorted (25.69% short volume ratio)
* April 14th -    379,924 shares shorted (16.61% short volume ratio)
* April 13th -    700,706 shares shorted (30.70% short volume ratio)
* April 12th -    135,778 shares shorted (15.36% short volume ratio)

5) Bartell Drugs acquisition just recently closed.  Unlikely to contribute to net earnings during the current fiscal year, but is expected to do so next year.  The acquisition makes Rite Aid the pharmacy leader in the Seattle market.

6) Year-to-Date high share price is $32.48 and there are only 55 millioin shares total outstanding.

7) The company has $3.1 billion in debt, which is being adequately managed (---meaning Rite Aid was able to service the debt, buy Bartell drugs, and still maintain positive cash flow last year).  For the new / current fiscal year, it appears likely that Rite Aid is positioned to book positive net earnings and cash flow (improving cash flow even further).

8) Break-up value of the company is likely in the range of $40 - $50 per share.

Does this sound like a company that should be trading at less than $18 per share with a market cap of just $1 billion?

Don't hesitate to pile on with the abuse.  After today, I am used to it."

1618528747.0,92,"Uh... TLRY **ALREADY** sells weed in the US. (CA, OR, WA). What am I missing?? Why are they allowed to be ""uplisted"" with a US footprint and MSOs can't???? 🤯🤯","So as an APHA **LONG**, I wanted to know why Tilray was claiming to be on her period and pushing back sexy time (merger vote). I found absolutely nothing about that, but here's what I *did* find. 

Tilray, [who owns Privateer Holdings](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/irisdorbian/2019/12/17/tilray-closes-merger-with-privateer/amp/) already sells their cannabis brand ""[Marley Natural](https://www.marleynatural.com/)"" in California, Oregon, and Washington. From the website: 

>""Currently available at select locations in CA, OR, and WA in accordance with local law. "" 

Want to confirm Tilray owns the brand? Check out their December investor presentation report. https://ir.tilray.com/events-and-presentations/events 

It's all the way at the bottom, and the ""family"" of brand logos are at the top of the report. Look for the lion. 

So, Tilray currently sells weed in 3 US States, but are still allowed to be uplisted? As I said before, I'm an APHA long, so I'm **all for it**, but still...wtf? Am I missing something?

Edit: Maybe pushing it past 4/20 when memelord Schumer is expected to drop the bill he's been teasing for months."

1618527101.0,381,Visualization of the daily discussion thread today,
1618526618.0,90,Tesla oops -$40k first day,
1618525214.0,254,PLUG is incredibly oversold and way under current stock valuation... And why it's going up at least 100%.,"PLUG is down over 60% from it's ATH. The renewable energy market was overbought and PLUG needed a pullback, similar to TSLA/NIO/FCEL/etc.

Bad News:

It got hit with an accounting error because of their auditors, KPMG. PLUG (mainly KPMG) has to reinstate it's financial results from 2018 to 2020. This caused investors to lose trust and tumble the stock into way oversold territory. Most analysts summarized the accounting issues to appear as minor but short-term worrisome, and there's limited near-term upside until resolution. This issue was 1 month ago when PLUG was trading around $48. It's nearly fallen by 50% since then.

Multiple law firms, primarily lead by ""Gross Law Firm"", also announced a class action lawsuit against PLUG. Causing it to drop ~10% more. Looking into Gross Law Firm, that's their entire business model, suing companies on behalf of shareholders on stocks that aren't performing well enough. In April alone they have opened up 9 new lawsuits against varies companies. Records show that most are settled out of court or completely dropped. In 2018 Gross Law Firm also opened a class action lawsuit against Tesla and look where TSLA is now.

Good News:

Wall Street already grossly underestimates the hydrogen energy sector. Currently Wall Street is valuing Hydrogen Energy to be roughly 1% of the world's energy. But forecasts show by 2025 it'll be between 5-12%. PLUG is the leading green energy hydrogen company. The O&G industry has reduced lobbying against Hydrogen Energy and is joining the sector: Chevron and Shell joined the Hydrogen Energy Council last year, and Exxon this year. The transition to Hydrogen Energy is starting to explode.

Last week PLUG was invited by the US department of defense to apply for a new $520 million loan guarantee. This news was still overshadowed by the accounting errors and hasn't reacted fully from it.  Upcoming news from the Biden administration will show they are ready, willing and able to provide strong support for hydrogen projects, increasing the valuating of PLUG.

Upon receiving approval from the DoE, PLUG will utilize its electrolyzer, liquefaction and distribution technologies to deploy the first resilient network of zero-carbon hydrogen production facilities across the United States. The facilities will have a combined liquid hydrogen generation capacity of approximately 180 tons per day. 

Let's review their balance sheet. PLUG also has over 1.3B of cash on hand. 1.6B in current assets and 800M in other assets. It has roughly ONLY 236M in current liabilities giving PLUG a huge advantage to invest in future energy projects mentioned above. OR settle any accounting issues, fines, or lawsuits. BABA (45x larger company) settled a $2.4B fine and the shares JUMPED 9% because investors were no longer worried, uncertainty was behind them. When PLUG reinstates it's accounting issues the stock WILL jump. Also, PLUG's 2021 financial reports have no errors and do not need to be reinstated. This is a problem in their past they need to solve.

PLUG also already has major contract supply deals with many top companies, including Amazon and Walmart, which are also current investors of PLUG. PLUG is working with Walmart to provide it with fuel cell-powered vehicles. There are plans for expansion of this deal sometime in 2021.

Looking at current analyst's price targets, 69% (ayyy) of analyst say BUY, only 1 (6%) says to SELL. The LOWEST price target for PLUG is $29, nearly $3 lower than today's close. The HIGHEST is $78, just a few dollars short of its 52-week high. Average is $57, which is 115% upside. Read this again... the lowest... price target... on PLUG... is $29. That is HIGHER than its current stock price.

For those who care about TA, even with over a 500% 1Y gain on PLUG, PLUG has just reached oversold territory based on a RSI of 30. For shorter term traders: the 4h and 1h are also hovering around 30. The Stochastic lines have crossed in every time measure, and it's entering an uptrend off the lows of today. Even if you don't believe PLUG long term, there's potential for a quick gain as this flies back to its support of $28-32 in the week or two.

TL;DR: PLUG is grossly oversold and will bounce back to around $30 in a couple weeks. Good news is being overshadowed by an accounting error and when that problem is settled, PLUG will fly. Average price target is $58, but my price target is $75 by EoY. Based on cash flow, Biden administration push for renewable energy, clean energy sector growing, and PLUG's plan for Hydrogen production facilities and vehicle research/production, PLUG can easily hit that $75 price sooner.

Positions: I've already purchased 60k in $25 and $30 strike calls expiring 1/2023. I plan to increase that by another 40k soon. If PLUG hits the average analyst price target by January of next year, I'll close my position when it crosses $500,000 value."

1618523773.0,106,"Is this post motivated by my own personal agenda? Yes. Yes it is, but this RKT play also makes sense so it's worth getting out there.","I watch lines move all day, but this is not financial advice. Truly, do what you will with this info. 

RKT has been seasoning for nearly a year. It has had time to establish a suppressed trend, and now it's time test new highs with a new trend very soon. This could also be last time to get in before the new trend establishes a higher floor. 

We should know the company's fundamentals are solid at this point, just find all the DD on it and read up if you don't. They make bank and continue to innovate RAPIDLY. I've been in through it all since IPO. 

**To more pressing matters, I believe there is a large option profit possibility here.** 

I believe whales are trying to make a lot of money off of options with RKT. They tried last week and failed. This week has more attention so I yolo'd 200 calls before the bell today - $23 strikes were 15 cents each. It closed at 22.76 today.  Max pain was well below 22.5 today, and shorts got wrecked before close. I am up 33% on those calls already in 5 seconds (for now). 

It could possibly gamma squeeze but it’ll probably need 50 Mil in volume. See picture below for open interest at $23 04/16). **That's half the float in volume, but only double the daily average**. When it went to $43 in March we did 368 mil in volume. 

There is 21k in open interest contracts at $23 calls 04/16s. There was a 10.5 million buy AH today (see picture). I saw another 89,920 share buy at 22.76 16:36:13 time stamp as I am typing this. Money is flowing in...why? My best guess is that the stock clearly is undervalued and institutions want to start making money on it sooner than later as they have been accumulating since IPO. 

Due to the small float, this stock MOVES parabolic on volume. Great company as we know at this point, but the stock sucks most of the time. It's constantly suppressed, but on the days it's not boring, those green candle sticks sky rocket on a 90 degree angle like there is no tomorrow. Meaning...options earn profits really really fast. So if it happens, don't get too greedy because theta will burn your options quick. I am hoping for a 25.5 - 27  per share to exit my calls with hopes of exercising. If it doesn't start early in the day, then ill probably roll my calls over to next week.

To make this happen - we need a catalyst (which is a possibility big money knows something), or we just need some retail help when the attack begins. Fair value IMO is $65, but I'll take somewhere between 25-30 before earnings. Lifetime PT $350a share by 2023. 

Just an FYI: this stock is notorious for false hope so expect the worse and hope for the best. I believe the low is $21 with a absolute worst case unlikely scenario of $18. So if you don't want to eff with the weeklies I would start buying shares here because it may not see $22 much longer and it's low risk to buy shares here IMO.  I also very confident in my June calls because they crush earnings every time - this will be their official 4th reported earnings as a public company.  I would anticipate that they want to leave the market will some fire news so that they utilize market cap for larger market share. RKT was never supposed to be a one hit wonder. 

TLDR: I like the stock and you should too. Keep an eye on it tomorrow if you can. Do with this what you will.

The following image shows a spliced version of a ten year chart to more easily compare the decline in the gold spot price during similar periods of economic stimulus.

&#x200B;

[GOLD SPOT PRICE DROP REPEAT?](https://preview.redd.it/xxe410k9gdt61.jpg?width=380&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=82efe65c4dc441a7130ce45912f94aa28cdb2cc2)

Much like we should expect in the 2013 reference, there are a few retests of highs, and the results were lower highs and lower lows. The yearlong trend was definitely downward. We see the same in the 2021 redline. These observations are obvious, but the important part of this spliced chart is the \~$200 drop in the spot price after failure of the fourth support test. I believe that this economic stimulus period will bring a repeat of that mid-2012 to mid-2013 time when investment capital shifted into confidence in the economic outlook. If I am correct, then a similar \~$200 drop in the gold spot price could be as near as tomorrow or as far as June. If the price drop is a % rather than a flat price drop, then the delta of the cliff could be between $250 or $300. In short, I believe gold approaches a \~15% cliff that could happen over a single day or week.

Even though I have been thinking about investing in gold product retailers mid-year (jewelry, electronic circuits and connectors), I have always preferred to invest in gold miners when I get that gold bug. I am not a bull or bear. I am a for-profit investor only. This increasing confidence in the economic outlook after so many challenges puts me in the bear camp now. When expecting big moves I usually consider trading in higher value names, and my recent positions in anticipation of this cliff down includes RGLD, a long established name in the gold trading sector that supports gold miners and gold investors as a ""streams and royalties"" company. I bought put options despite the jump in the gold spot price today, and the subsequent rise in the stock price of RGLD.

1. $115p May 21 '21 (x1) at cost $5.50
2. $115p May 21 '21 (x1) at cost $3.80
3. $115p Apr 16 '21 (x2) at cost $0.50

**TLDR:** I believe that the gold spot price approaches a \~15% cliff that could happen over a single day or week, and my bet is that RGLD will be a profitable short play because of its close relation to gold miners and the gold spot price."
1618507632.0,181,HYLN Pt. 2: A Fair Warning,"Hey guys, I posted the DD about HYLN yesterday that got some traction on WSB, and I'm back with more insight. I tried posting this new discussion on both WSB and WSBOG right after market open, but it seems that my account has some issue with posting new threads -- none of my posts ever go through without mod approval, despite being added as a [contributor to the sub](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7l0p0/gme_disinfo_exposed_1_why_the_gme_moass_post_that/grburu2/).

Anyway, this time I'm posting about why you should be **wary** about short-term hype surrounding HYLN. I know that may shock you after yesterday's post, but read on -- you'll probably feel like I'm preaching to the choir, here.

# ...What?

Let me start by saying that I believe in the potential of this company -- its *long-term potential*. This isn't a short squeeze, this isn't a quick turn around, this isn't a few dollars you throw at some FDs. This is a stock with a **real** chance of going gangbusters in the next few years.

I've noticed [posts celebrating](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mrdeqb/hyliion_moon_time/) HYLN's premarket rise. HYLN is *often* green premarket and then descends into the fiery red depths of hell slightly after 9:30am. This is a common market manipulation technique: it's ***easy*** and ***cheap*** to buy stocks up during premarket/after hours because the float is so low, so it doesn't take much to push a stock up. Then, once the stock starts off high, and retail FOMO in, that's when the big boys dump the bags on you. **Premarket and AH mean jack shit.**

So why am I warning you? Because I've noticed some really suspicious activity since posting yesterday. I feel I owe it to you to let you know what I've noticed. Also, my parents raised me to be incredibly honest. Not gonna lie, it's a bit of a drawback sometimes, but like George ""Motherfucking"" Washington, I cannot tell a lie.

Also, this isn't entirely selfless -- paper hands sink stocks. I want you guys to know what you're getting into. I want you to know what we're up against. I want you to know why it's important to be in it for the long haul (haha trucking joke, get it?)

First, let's talk about APU.

# High APU Rating

This is something I wrote about in a previous post about [GME disinformation](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbh9xe/disinfo_exposed_2_how_hedge_funds_and_useful_apes/) that wasn't permitted on WSB: the APU ratio (Awards Per Upvote ratio).

I ran some numbers for the typical amount of awards for every upvote for randomly-selected posts from different categories of posts:

* Posts by DFV
* Pro-GME posts (during the period when it topped out the second time -- 1 month ago)
* Pro-silver posts
* Pre-GME DD posts

[You can see the results here.](https://i.postimg.cc/8zqqPrHx/Awards-Per-Upvote.png) I chose these categories, because I figured DFV's posts were a decent representation of organic posting in WSB -- they're easy to digest and impressive enough to merit awards. They're probably on the higher end of what an authentic post could expect to receive in terms of awards on WSB. When compared to pre-GME DD posts, you'll see that my theory stands correct: DFV's have an APU ratio almost 10x higher than pre-GME DD posts. DFV's post had an average APU of 0.0323.

I also looked at pro-silver posts, because there was a consensus that silver sentiment was being manipulated in WSB. It's no coincidence that silver died immediately the day after after media started pushing a misleading narrative that ""Silver had become the next GME"" ([Source](https://i.ibb.co/8bpLNv0/slvscam.png)). I noticed that silver posting had an APU higher than DFV's posts. The most upvoted pro-silver post had an APU **more than 3x DFV's average APU, and much higher than even his highest APU ratio.** Pro-GME posts were similarly high.

I ran some numbers on my own post yesterday, after someone raised this same suspicion.

The APU for [my post yesterday](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqrfzf/hyln_how_we_got_here_where_were_going_aka_the_moon/) was abnormally high. It's 0.0664, which is...:

* twice that of DFV's average
* higher than a random selection of 10/11 of DFV's higher-upvoted posts
* almost twice that of pro-GME posts (during a time of what I believe was ongoing astroturfing and positive sentiment manipulation)
* much higher than that of silver (though admittedly I used a small sample size)
* over 10x that of pre-GME WSB

Now, it's important to qualify this: taken alone, this data could just be merely coincidental. There's a lot that can explain it: gracious HYLN owners finally seeing their stock get its dues, random weirdness, etc. Taken alone, this data might not mean much. So let's contextualize it.

Let's look at...

# Suspicious social media activity

The [exact same user](https://i.ibb.co/KGRGKjt/censored.png) kept rewarding my post -- 9 awards over 7 hours. How often would you stick around 7 hours to award the exact same post?

Okay, not enough to be conclusive, but...

[Look at his account page](https://i.ibb.co/HK5xhfm/shillbot.png). Lots of warning flags:

* Extremely low karma
* Posts exclusively in WSB
* Has an award for gilding so many goddamn people
* Formed Jan 27th (which corresponds to a lot of pro-hedgie activity, based on my observations)

Okay, now in context the picture is starting to become a bit more clear...

Here's [one even better](https://i.ibb.co/HK5xhfm/shillbot.png) \-- this is what these guys like to do. They give a stock pick, give an extremely specific date. ""BUY TOMORROW IT'S GONNA EXPLODE"" and then the next two days the stock craters 10%.

I feel a bit like I'm wearing a tinfoil hat when I say shit like this, but do you think I'm making this up? [Think again](https://i.ibb.co/56LJp04/shortbot.png). If you (weak, puny, individual investor) buy, it's easier for them (hedge funds, billionaires, shorters, shitillionaires) to sell into your buys. They get a better price to short at, *and* they get to shake your paper hands.

In all honesty, I made some pretty good money finding these shills and inversing them. Even still, I tried to warn about them before, but my post was censored. This level of disgusting control and manipulation just does NOT sit right with me. If this thread is what helps expose this manipulative bullshit, I don't really care that it sacrifices a money-making strategy that I've used to 100% success up until now. Fuck hedge funds, basically. Fuck billionaires trying to shake a few cents from the little guy.

For the record, any time a poster whose name starts with ""**Ad**Something####"" (for, y'know, ***advertisement***) starts getting bullish on a stock, that  freaks me the fuck out. Especially if they only have a 2 month old account. Look around with a critical eye and you'll see what I'm talking about.

Oh, and remember yesterday in my posts when I talked about an account on Stocktwits that shitposts about HYLN literally all day every day? Well, [he's back](https://stocktwits.com/jshetty7200), and I can confirm that, based on his posting style and patterns, that's definitely him. Curious he came back the exact same day I made the HYLN bullish post, no?

**tl;dr:**

**HYLN is still being manipulated. Wouldn't be surprised if it continues trending down for the short-term as it shakes out weak paper hands. Think about why. I'm holding this stock until something FUNDAMENTAL changes about the company. Day-to-day red and green doesn't change my thesis. Paper hands get shook.**"
1618506774.0,50,Cattle Futures - buy the dip?,"Don't know what to buy? Buy SPX/SPY/ES and don't look back. Jeez how many times do we have to teach you, old man? 

Have a bit of spare change left? Consider buying some cattle, whose drop in the last few days does not make sense in light of faster economic growth and higher feed prices. 

[June 2021 Futures](https://preview.redd.it/6e9ns0kpbdt61.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e7e8427c27f04cc3e75c42e700a162fcf97aa08)

1. For cattle, the most important factor quite honestly is the supply. More cattle than what is demanded (domestically or internationally) means subdued prices. Right now, this is the primary driver, as [young calves raised in late 2020](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/animal-products/cattle-beef/market-outlook/) in anticipation of economic recovery in early 2021 are showing up on the lots. As of right now, demand is OK - just OK with Americans coming back to restaurants, even though the rest of the world isn't. Like what was driving oil prices (up to yesterday when the IEA upgraded all forecasts), the rest of the world is significantly lagging the US in recovery. 
2. Feed prices are critical to cattle as well (namely corn and soybeans). These have been on a tear in the past few weeks due to fewer than expected planted acres, and the current cold front across the midwest. If the feed becomes too expensive, it becomes more costly to fatten cattle, making less available to market, especially for the June contract as the time to fatten is now. 
3. The backlog is about to end. The massive oversupply has been in play for about 6 months already - from October to April. Every commodity has seen the same cycle post-pandemic - a massive depressing of prices, only for the entire market to realize they've been too pessimistic, and then sudden rally. 

&#x200B;

It seems like cattle is one of the last agri laggard - corn, soy, hogs and lumber have already punched through the roof. I'm heavily in corn gang, but overall I'm bullish all soft commodities. Buy a few contracts and see what happens, and I'll be sure to report back when I find 18 metric tons of beef on my front porch."

1618501721.0,14,"$MDU - Strong Financials, Consistent Growth, Solid Dividend - Why MDU Resources is a Buy","I wanted to find a stable company to add to my portfolio. One with strong fundamentals, a decent dividend and solid growth potential. I came across MDU Resources, headquartered in North Dakota and operates as a diversified utility, pipeline, construction services company.

MDU Resources has continued to execute well amidst a challenging economy. It recently achieved near record-breaking results and has strategic investments planned for this year. I have highlighted some of the key points on my analysis below

Company

Construction and utility provider MDU Resources (MDU) had a tough 2020. Construction projects were halted or delayed in a lot of cases, and utility stocks weren’t exactly in favor with investors during a period when growth stocks reigned supreme. Still, for long-term investors with an eye on value and yield, I think MDU is a great choice.

MDU Resources Group, Inc.’s MDU two-platform business model, strategic acquisitions, capital investments in the electric and natural gas utility plus improving backlog are its key tailwinds. Also, the company boasts enough liquidity to meet its near-term obligations.

Some key highlights on why I think it might be a good pick up for your portfolio

**Consistent long-term growth at 9.3% EBITDA CAGR and 16.7% EPS CAGR**

* Stocks with higher earnings-per-share growth rates are generally more desired by investors than those with slower earnings-per-share growth rates. This is a good sign for MDU and has a decent shot at beating earnings upcoming in early May
* Balance of cyclical and counter cyclical business with almost a 50/50 split between construction and regulated energy. this bodes well for the long run and will likely be a stable performer in the market

**Runway of attractive organic and inorganic growth opportunities**

* Organic Growth: We are all familiar with the infrastructure spending bill that was passed in the UIS and MDU stand to benefit from this.
* Inorganic Growth: **MDU Resources (MDU) Arm Buys Mt. Hood Rock, Expands in Portland (**[**here**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mdu-resources-mdu-arm-buys-163304894.html)**)** These investments will be aimed at enhancing the reliability of the company’s services, thus enabling it to serve an increasing customer base, effectively. MDU Resources anticipates its electric and natural gas utility segment to see a CAGR of 5% and expects its customer base to expand 1-2%, annually.

**Improving ROIC driven by rigorous capital allocation process**

* Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a calculation used to assess a company's efficiency at allocating the capital under its control to profitable investments. The return on invested capital ratio gives a sense of how well a company is using its capital to generate profits.
* A company is thought to be creating value if its ROIC exceeds 2% and destroying value if it is less than 2%. MDU Resources Group's ROIC % is 6.29% (calculated using TTM income statement data).
* MDU Resources Group generates higher returns on investment than it costs the company to raise the capital needed for that investment. It is earning excess returns. A firm that expects to continue generating positive excess returns on new investments in the future will see its value increase as growth increases.

**Valuation**

I find MDU to be attractively priced at $31.29, with a blended PE of 15.9. This sits below MDU's historical PE of 19.4 over the past decade,

Analysts also express a bullish view on the stock, with a consensus Buy rating and an average price target of $34.33, implying a 10% upside potential from the current share price.

**Earnings**

Earnings are forecast to grow 6.74% per year and Earnings grew by 16.6% over the past year. If this trend continues, we will likely see a rise in the share price

**Insider Trading**

Significant insider buying over the last year with a majority of shares purchased in May 2020. This would make sense considering the price dropped off a cliff just a month prior. The management team knew it was a bargain and acted on the low share price

https://preview.redd.it/mm0ufvp1zct61.png?width=1409&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a48dd33dfa8bc4e1266ce88b085e687234e36f4

# Risks

**Biden’s Infrastructure Plan** \- While I see potential tailwinds for MDU's construction business from Biden's proposed infrastructure plan, there's no guarantee that such a proposal will pass. The construction business is more cyclical than the regulated utility business, and adds complexity risk to MDU's business model.

**Mild Dilution** \- MDU relies on both equity and debt to fund capital projects. This includes $100M in expected equity issuances this year, which will be mildly dilutive to shareholders

# TLDR

I'm encouraged by the impressive earnings it generated amidst a challenging economy. Based o some of the key factors and management guidance I see continued growth for MDU for the foreseeable future. I continue to find the valuation to be attractive and the dividend to be well-covered and safe. Consider looking at MDU and potentially adding it to your portfolio.

1618497335.0,124,AMC Discussion,"Recently, I've diversified my portfolio and put it all in AMC. Personally, I think AMC has a ton of potential for several reasons:

1. 99% of AMC theaters are now open, and the pandemic has eliminated many of their competitors. Plus, there is a international surge in movie crowds as the pandemic seems to be slowing down
2. AMC is a great momentum stock almost certain to climb higher. It has gained 96.33% this past quarter while the S&P have only moved up 2.3% respectively.
3. AMC has a zacks rank 2# (buy) ranking, basically saying that its positive earning outlook could easily translate to buying pressure which in turn would push the stock up.

Alright, these are my reasons, and whether you agree or not, thanks for reading and please comment on your thoughts.

P.S This not necessarily financial advice, nor am i a financial expert, this is just my humble opinion of the stock.

Edit: So a lot of people have been talking about the pandemic and how watching movies at home is the thing now, so I just to point out 3 things:

1. AMC at some point may shift their marketing strategy so we should dismiss it's growth off the the way it is operating now.
2. Also, watching movies at home is not the same as at a theater, the screen is not as bigger  and the experience as a whole is different. (Think imax and 3d stuff). Plus, people have been binge watching netflix the whole pandemic, by now they are probably ready for a change. 
3. Lastly, when it comes to the pandemic, people are getting vaccinated and they are getting more used to social distancing and masks. The point is not that people will cram back into theaters. They will come back with safety measures (social distancing, masks, etc ) and more importantly, they will feel safe and comfortable with this new normal. (unlike at the start where is was just total confusion.)"

1618491419.0,1728,AMC filed with the SEC its promise not to issue any of the 500m shares if authorized in 2021 - but what does this really mean?,"TLDR at the bottom. 

The CEO of AMC has publicly promised yesterday to submit in writing with the SEC that AMC does not plan to issue any of the 500m shares if authorized by shareholders in May. 

Happy to report that as of this morning AMC filed [Statement 14A](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/e5d2e721-c60b-4f74-9f90-7e970a8fc426.html) reiterating exactly what AA said in the interview: 

 
>**Adam Aron**: We are going to pledge right now today publicly and we will file this publicly so it will be binding on us, because you can’t announce intentions and then not carry through it, we hereby pledge at AMC that if the shareholders approve this authorization for 500 million new shares to be issued we will not use one of those 500 million shares in calendar year 2021. Not one. Not one.
 
>. . .
 
>**Adam Aron**: If we need to raise some cash in the short term, remember we already have 43 million shares that are out there that were authorized in the year 2013 that we could use if we wish to raise some cash, if we decide that’s a good idea. We have made no decisions yet. We are thinking about it, but we haven’t made any decisions yet.

This is a cause for cautious celebration - the CEO stands by his statement, and is serious about keeping the promise. 

But, the emphasis is on cautious. First rule of sound investing - read the fine print. That’s how they screw you. 


>Should one or more of these risks, trends, uncertainties or facts [listed above] materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those indicated or anticipated by the forward-looking statements contained herein. **Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.** Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved.

Let me unpack this for you. **AMC is saying that if any of the bad things they listed in the statement happen  they will not hesitate one moment to issue more shares.**. Theater openings delayed? More shares. AMC can’t pay its interest and debt on schedule? More shares. Motion pictures companies don’t want to screen their movies at theaters for months and go to their own digital platform after two weeks? You got it, more shares. 

**STAY DILIGENT AND DO WHATS BEST FOR YOUR WALLET**

Seen many people switch to an automatic “yes” on their vote. I won’t be one of those people. 

I’m not an advisor or your advisor, financial or otherwise. I’m just a guy with thousands of AMC shares who likes to read the fine print and make weighted decisions based on facts. 

Full disclosure - I sold a third of my April 2019 shares in January to recoup basis and take profits. The rest is in for the ride as it’s all pure profit, so naturally I want it to go as high as possible.

TLDR: good news the CEO stood by his promise. Bad news they can still issue more shares if the situation gets worse this year. My “no” vote stands."

This may sound stupid but it’s actually the most logical play that know one is thinking or talking about. So TLRY is buying out APHA and therefore your APHA shares will convert to TLRY shares. TLRY is the bigger more valuable company. If you have 500 dollars in APHA it will be converted to TLRY regardless of the share price.  

Here’s where the hidden logic comes in. The best play is to accumulate as much APHA and drive the price up as high as possible, squeeze out the rest of the shorts and hold.

On the other end of the spectrum sell all of your TLRY shares and beat this ticker to the curb. The lower this goes the better. TLRY actually has a high short interest but trust me let the gay bears have this one.

If the APHA shares can surpass the price of the TLRY shares it will be bigger than the original moon landing.  

Once the merger happens those who have 💎👐’s will be rewarded with more TLRY shares than they had APHA shares.  TLRY will then way undervalued and everyone will start to pile in.

If you still don’t get it, imagine TSLA buying out NKLA, you’d want NKLA to be as high as possible at the merger and TSLA as low as possible.

1618455762.0,598,"Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest Buys Nearly 750,000 Shares of Coinbase",
1618454005.0,77,$COIN = MOON POTENTIAL,"Have been seeing a lot of negativity around Coinbase so wanted to provide an echo chamber for us bulls who FOMO'd in near the open.

First off, Coinbase should not be valued as an exchange, it makes no sense to compare it to Nasdaq or NYSE. COIN is rapidly growing, has a vastly different transaction structure, and is beginning to expand into the services market.

Now let's get into some numbers. 2020 Revenue was 1.28 B which is 140% growth over 2019, that is ridiculous. The really crazy number, 1.8 B in revenue for Q1 2021. They had 50% more revenue in Q1 2021 than the entirety of 2020. Let that sink in for a minute. Net Income for Q1 2021 was also around 750 M. If they were to sustain this net income for the rest of the year, that would put them at a 28 P/E ratio... for a company growing this quick? It's important to keep in mind that this was a record quarter for COIN and likely not sustainable near term but it still shows what they are capable of. 

Additionally, they announced that they are up to 56 million users with 6.1 of those being Monthly Transacting Users (MTUs) in Q1 2021. This is a massive jump over the previous quarter and COIN explains that the rise in MTUs is largely due to the increase in price and volatility around virtual currencies. For some reference, Robinhood has 13 million monthly users but get nowhere near the revenue per user that COIN does. These ""virtual currencies"" have continued increasing so far in Q2 2021 so I am expecting another knockout quarter in both revenue and MTUs. Expect the Q2 earnings report to blow past expectations (think massive tendie spike).

Speaking of those beefy transaction fees that COIN gets, there's no way that's sustainable right? It's going to be a race to the bottom, just like the stock trading fees? Well, not exactly. Investors love how simple Coinbase makes trading and are willing to pay a small premium for this ease of use. Currently, fees are massive percentagewise for small trades but become pretty reasonable at a large scale. I could see them lowering rates significantly for these small trades once they build up some more consistent institutional trading revenue and service revenue. 

There's probably some reason to worry about declining margins in the transaction side of the business, however, that's not why COIN deserves to hit $500+. Coinbase's services platform is massively undervalued and is something the mainstream media largely ignores. This segment of the business is growing very quickly and should not be overlooked. If you look at what Cathie Wood says about digital wallets, it should be clear how much potential Coinbase has to monetize it's users. It's creating an entire financial ecosystem built around Coinbase that's designed to keep users around.

So I would like to start by saying that this thread was born as a reply to a user but, since it has become quite long and I think that some users might like to read it, I thought to post it directly. The discussion comes from a user who sends me 2 links, respectively

Black Rock Fund Advisor [https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=0001006249](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=0001006249)

I answered pragmatically indicating 2 links of response (I know I was wrong to paste only 2 links without explaining why but I thought that those who understood my post, would understand immediately)

Well now let's read the comment that disputes my thread:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wtzq228jw7t61.png?width=858&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4208ab78e36d1541bb5585b0b96311bd65aa001

1 - ""You directly linked to a position of BR-FA ownership in GME, and now it is useless? Come on dude, do better""

The reason I pasted the 2 links, as a response to the post was to show that there are no updated positions as of 3/31/2021 from Black Rock Fund Advisors. There are no updates since 2017!

&#x200B;

2- ""That 13F-HR is the most recent holdings report. Can you show me where BR-FA sold?""

This is where it gets interesting. You can see that just after that date of the most recent 13F-HR (Filed 2017-02-10), Black Rock Fund Advisors has not submitted any more 13F-HR forms to note their positions. You can check it out for yourself:

[https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/?r=el#/dateRange=custom&ciks=0001006249&entityName=BlackRock%2520Fund%2520Advisors%2520(CIK%25200001006249)&startdt=2016-02-01&enddt=2020-02-01](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/?r=el#/dateRange=custom&ciks=0001006249&entityName=BlackRock%2520Fund%2520Advisors%2520(CIK%25200001006249)&startdt=2016-02-01&enddt=2020-02-01)

In lieu of submitting the 13F-HR, Black Rock Fund Advisor has begun submitting a 13F-NT form. What's different? Just open the Form to find out:

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1006249/000108636417000052/xslForm13F\_X01/primary\_doc.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1006249/000108636417000052/xslForm13F_X01/primary_doc.xml)

You can tell right away what is written there:

13F NOTICE. (Check here if no holdings reported are in this report, and all holdings are reported by other reporting manager(s).)

and

List of Other Managers Reporting for this Manager:

If there are no entries in this list, omit this section.

    	Form 13F File Number Name
    
    028-12019 BlackRock Inc.

&#x200B;

Look who is taking all the trouble to post the positions of their subsidiaries, but it is BLACK ROCK INC!!!!!!!

With this 13F- NT Black Rock Fund Advisor is basically saying: from today on, my daddy Black Rock Inc will take charge of everything I have!

From here on Black Rock Fund Advisor presented only 13F-NT form (and bought only 4-5 stocks to date).

But let's see what was happening to Black Rock Inc in the meantime....

These are the positions of BlackRock Inc on 2017-02-10 taken from 13F-HR:

&#x200B;

What do you notice? Black Rock Inc had very few GME shares.

&#x200B;

But let's analyze the next 13F-HR submitted by Black Rock Inc on 2017-05-12:

&#x200B;

But it's magic!!!! Black Rock Inc owns as many as 14 positions!!! But how is that possible!!!! Oh my god!!! Burn the witch!!!!

But let's analyze the front page of this Form 13F-HR from 2017-05-12:

Source: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364742/000108636417000069/xslForm13F\_X01/primary\_doc.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364742/000108636417000069/xslForm13F_X01/primary_doc.xml)

&#x200B;

Let's analyze the most important passages:

13F COMBINATION REPORT. (Check here if a portion of the holdings for this reporting manager are reported in this report and a portion are reported by other reporting manager(s).)

and

Provide a numbered list of the name(s) and Form 13F file number(s) of all institutional investment managers with respect to which this report is filed, other than the manager filing this report.

If there are no entries in this list, state ""NONE"" and omit the column headings and list entries.

[Look who is on the list, but it is indeed BLACK ROCK FUND ADVISOR!!!](https://preview.redd.it/4a8h3z6nx7t61.png?width=1408&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c29fb4eb43a2117bd7732eed42c953b2f764285)

&#x200B;

With that I have shown you how from 2017-05-12 onwards Black Rock Inc has taken over the position of all their subsidiaries. The evolutions of those GME positions over time you can check for yourself.

Also check out opening Black Rock Inc's position on the bloomberg terminal what comes up:

&#x200B;

Let's come to the other point made by the user

""Also, in your Fidelity sale filing, pay attention to section 7. They moved the securities to another company.

""Item 7. Identification and Classification of the Subsidiary Which Acquired the Security Being Reported on By the Parent Holding Company.

See attached Exhibit A.""

Here he is referring to an old post that came out at the time of the Fidelity GME sale posted on the GME forum. I have already replied to this kind of comment and I paste one of my answers:

I've already been shown the thread you mean ( you can find it in the comments on my post on s u p e r s t o n k ). The author of the post is simply wrong because:

&#x200B;

1 - There is no reference whatsoever to a transfer of shares

2- But let's say for sure that the author is right, where is the new SEC filing? Why on bloomberg terminal has disappeared fidelity from January 29 onwards?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i0dkml8u1qt61.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef36a26be1aa1cc524a8d18f2e530ab66a323a45

3- If there had been a real transfer there would be SEC filings with different C    I      K's

4- For those who want to believe the fairy tale of the transfer of ownership through ITEM 7 I just say go check out the other 13Gs

EXAMPLE:

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000315066/000031506619001099/filing.txt](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000315066/000031506619001099/filing.txt)

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000315066/000031506617001695/filing.txt](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000315066/000031506617001695/filing.txt)

I took 2 at random, they all have the fucking wording : ""

Item 7. Identification and Classification of the Subsidiary Which

Acquired the Security Being Reported on By the Parent Holding Company.

"" and

""Exhibit A

Pursuant to the instructions in Item 7 of Schedule 13G,

the following table lists the identity and Item 3 classification, if

applicable, of each relevant entity that beneficially owns shares of the

security class being reported on this Schedule 13G.""

Opening every 13G there is this wording, following the reasoning Fidelity likes to pass shares in every fucking 13G xD.

&#x200B;

I would like to add that after reading what I have written here, it should be clearer why Fidelity has SOLD and not moved shares.

&#x200B;

I want to conclude by saying that after posting my GME counter DD, I received many positive comments that understood what I was talking about but also many others that did not understand. It's okay to not understand some things, I didn't understand them when I started either. But I get annoyed by those who try to counter what I have written with really meaningless arguments that only show that they have not understood anything about the subject and have little knowledge on the subject. This is why I sometimes respond badly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT: since so many people ask for it here is a TLDR

TLDR: Fidelity does not own any GME stock, all the positions you see on the finra site ie: Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC, FMR Inc and Fidelity Management and Research Company are an error. Fidelity sold in January.  Instead the position of Black Rock Inc which owns 9,217,335 is confirmed. The other Black Rock Fund Advisors which owns 10m shares is wrong.

&#x200B;

TLDR's TLDR: The finra data are completely wrong and are not to be taken into account"
1618440361.0,517,$COIN: $150B ($570/share) Price Target,"TLDR:

* $COIN collects revenue on trading USD VOLUME not asset prices. More trading, buying, *and* selling = more revenue
* Each cycle has introduced a new volume range
* Paypal's and Square's (and Affirm's) valuation indicate the markets are willing to price fintech at large multiples

We can readily compare $COIN against Paypal and Square: they all offer peer-to-peer payment solutions, are involved in the currency space, and offer exchange services. While, PYPL and SQ both offer more established merchant solutions that's not to discredit $COIN's efforts in enabling businesses to accept currency via its 'commerce' service, which could become popular as opinions and usage continue to increase favorably.

$COIN's [Q1 Numbers](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/06/coinbase-reports-estimated-q1-revenue-of-1point8-billion-up-nine-fold.html)

* $1.8 Billion Revenue
* $800 Million Profit
* 56 Million users

Using these numbers, we can approximate the annual numbers:

* $7.2 Billion Annual Revenue
* $3.2 Billion Annual Profit

**This is making 2 quite large assumptions:**

1. Quarterly revenue is not seasonal -- revenues from Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 are approximately equivalent
2. Revenue is *sustained* \-- revenue is not dependent on asset prices, but rather trading volume. More on this later

# ^ Assuming that revenue streams are sustainable and continue to grow, there's no reason why $COIN can't trade at $150B, when compared to Paypal and Square multiples

# 

# Argument for Sustained Revenue

* **$COIN** collects fees on buying *and* selling. If the assets were to suddenly correct, $COIN will still collect fees on the sell side. **We can make a strong claim that $COIN's revenues are primarily dependent on volume, not asset prices**

1618439111.0,209,"$APHA discount, $TLRY merger soon","Hey ladies and gents, consider this post your friendly reminder that the thing we've all been waiting for (the APHA/TLRY merger) is just weeks away. Of course, this is a wendy's, not a financial consultancy, so this is not advice, but APHA's slide as of late is quite contrary to future market expectations with NY legalization and VA speeding things along. Schumer and the Dems have indicated legalization is a priority. Biden will probably(?) sign it.

APHA is at a large discount following this week's slide. (Roughly a 14% discount to be exact.) Consider that an APHA share = .83 TLRY shares and you have a pretty substantial gain to be made if you buy APHA at this price and it converts to TLRY at the current price of $17.40. My crayon-napkin math indicates a gain of about 2-3% using current prices.

On top of that, the combined entity TLRY (following the merger) will be the largest weed company by revenue, meaning they'll likely be able to swallow a lot of market share in the US and EU following U.S. legalization, the EU thing is already ongoing.

APHA as a discounted TLRY share is pretty good right now, especially because they move in parallel with TLRY always being more valuable. From there, seems like a hold on TLRY, which most actual advisors seem to agree with."

I know that some of you are very mad, cuz you bought into the wsb hype, but what happened tha last 2 days is absolutely normal and actually should be expected. Despite the fact that some retail investors think that those kind of events are some huge catalysts, they are just events that are intended to show investors and potential customers the capabilities of the company's products.

However, retail investors hype themselves up and buy the stock just before the event, cuz they either think that others will follow suite or that they will show some ridiculous, innovative technology or product. This of course does not happen, so they immediatly sell their shares, cuz they were in for the short-term anyway. At battery day Elon showed the huge progress that Tesla have made on potentially world-changing battery technology, but shares dumped by more than 15 percent the next day for the following reasons - 1- Tesla did not show an electric jet or a flying car 2. They did not understand anything about what was said and found the event boring 3.They were short-term traders that just played the catalyst. The same thing happened on the day that Apple showed the new Iphone- runup before the event and dump after. Both stocks are up big today.

Now before you ask why didn't you sell your shares if you expected the share price to decrease, I will tell you. Most successful investors will tell you that if you actually believe in the long-term growth of the company, you should not try to time the market. I bought PLTR's CFD's (certificates for difference) at DPO and almost convinced myslef to sell at 15, cuz I throught that the rally will be unsustainable in the short-term, but I am glad that I did not do that and instead I sold at 30. I bought shares this time at 24 average price. Of course I know that even if you are a long-term investor you will still want the share price to increase in the short-term ( there is something called opportunity cost) and I personally would like it better if the company was more transparent with the media and investors, but it is what it is. Just remember that the share price will definitely increase only if PLTR accelerates its revenue growth and customer acquisitions, everything else is speculation.

This is not a financial advice and I promise you that Peter Thiel is not funding my posts."

I've known at some point that /r/wallstreetbets will have to find a place for it.  As much as some of us hate it, there are just as many that love it and the way I've always tried to shape the sub is to never gatekeep, allow everyone to feel welcome, and always be able to adapt.  I don't see the point in delaying the inevitable anymore as crypto is here to stay.

# Bullish reasoning:

[I don't know any technical mumbo-jumbo, but here's the chart, earnings is in May or June](https://preview.redd.it/36ilqo9hu5t61.jpg?width=2277&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ccfa6ffbc1d2347ec05c25e57372ac2e4b7c7020)

*You must see all the images to understand my DD, I don't know why reddit messed up my formatting*

Earnings will be beaten handsomely by STMP, as COVID hasn't really subsumed. Plus, the stock has a pretty big future considering the slow but sure shift to online sales.

# Bear points:

1. The moat is not necessarily the strongest, management has to continually deliver to keep on growing. I am fairly confident that they can do it. But you may not be.

2. Too conservative management. You can easily see this from their non-existent debt and huge cash position.

3. Too low volume. Float is also only 18M. Options bid-ask spread is wild.

**Common question: Why did the stock drop so much in 2019 and stuff?**

Answer: They had an exclusivity deal with USPS where they got a lot of money for that deal. But management intentionally dropped it as USPS couldn't make 2 day delivery or the fast delivery requirements that is necessary to compete.

The market reacted very badly for this short-term bump in the road. But COVID-19 has proved that management was right all along and it was absolutely necessary to drop that deal to grow the company.

**Conclusion:** I think the stock will pretty reliably beat the upcoming earning and the stock will jump heavily before the earnings only to dump a little or a lot after the earnings. Basically, buy the rumour, sell... However, the stock is also a pretty decent one for long term holdings too.

[https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-07676.pdf](https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-07676.pdf)

The purpose of the proposed rule change is to enhance the Exchange’s Retail Price Improvement Program for the **benefit of retail investors.** Specifically, the Exchange proposes to make the following four changes: (i) revise the definition of Retail order in IEX Rule 11.190(b)(15) to **apply only to the trading interest of a natural person that does not place more than 390 equity orders per day** on average during a calendar month for its own beneficial account(s);7 (ii) **provide Order Book8 priority to Retail Liquidity Provider (“RLP”) orders9 at the Midpoint Price10 ahead of other non-displayed orders priced to execute at the Midpoint Price;** (iii) disseminate a “Retail Liquidity Identifier” through the Exchange’s proprietary market data feeds and the appropriate securities information processor (“SIP”) when RLP order interest aggregated to form at least one round lot for a particular security is available in the System,11 provided that the RLP order interest is resting at the Midpoint Price and is **priced at least $0.001 better than the NBB12 or NBO13**; and (iv) amend the definition of RLP orders so **such orders can only be midpoint peg orders**,14 cannot be Discretionary Peg orders,15 and cannot include a minimum quantity restriction.16 The proposed changes are designed to further support and enhance the ability of non-professional retail investors to obtain meaningful price improvement by incentivizing market participants to compete to provide such price improvement.

Retail Liquidity Provider means a broker that routes retail orders through the IEX. You can call your broker and see if they are an RLP for IEX.

Read some of the DD to learn a bit on how **non displayed orders** are likely being used by citadel and friends to manipulate the price.

Overall, it seems like a major step in the right direction to help level the playing field. It looks like it has to go through the traditional comment period before approval. (Not an advance notice).

TL;DR: This completely negates the ability for other firms to see retail orders before execution and then act accordingly to manipulate the price. This would give retail orders **Priority over other non-displayed orders. It would also force the broker to enter the trade at the midpoint price (Ie between ask and bid). Previously, this could be manipulated to decrease the price by consistently filling orders at lower and lower prices so that even though people are buying, the price drops.**

Still reading will add more as needed.

Enough about me. Let’s talk stock. Let's talk Hyliion.

*Note: This is an interactive post. That means you're expected to click the links before you leave a dumbass comment.*

# HYLIION (HYLN): The fuck???

Hyliion is a company that develops and sells electric powertrain systems for transport trucks involved in long-distance trucking. Their drivetrain -- the Hypertruck ERX -- is fueled by compressed natural gas (CNG) and/or renewable natural gas (RNG), which are MUCH more green than diesel, which is used by most trucking companies. RNG can even achieve **negative emissions**. You know when you turn loose an earth-shaking fart in a very public setting, and you just wish you could suck that noxious gas back up inside you to avoid further humiliation from that flower-wilting smell? Well, this is almost identical to that. Kind of.

I know what you're thinking: *""So what? This dinosaur can un-fart gas. Aren't we moving away from gas and towards fully electric, hydrogen-powered, and nuclear fusion-powered vehicles anyway?""*

There's a few things to keep in mind:

* Stuff needs to get shipped TODAY
* There **aren't** enough plug-in refueling stations for **transport trucks** in the US
* There **aren't** enough hydrogen refueling stations in the US (only 39 currently)
* There **are** currently enough CNG and RNG refueling stations for the trucking industry
* CNG/RNG is currently 1/12 the price of hydrogen and 1/7 the price of electric refueling
* In the future, CNG/RNG will be 1/3 the price of hydrogen, and 1/2 the price of electric refueling
* HYLN's powertrain is designed specifically to be able to be used with hydrogen in the future, anyway
* Trucking companies aren't going to want to wait around [30 minutes](https://www.businessinsider.com/this-expert-says-tesla-semi-is-economically-and-ecologically-pointless-2019-2) for their trucks to get an 80% charge every [500 miles](https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a34774933/musk-now-says-621-miles-of-range-for-tesla-semi/) (source: latest max range \* 80%) using a theoretical megacharger station which [doesn't even exist](https://www.torquenews.com/11663/tesla-looking-develop-so-called-megachargers-tesla-semi-trucks) currently, and also lose 1 ton in carrying capacity due to the weight of the battery

Source: [https://i.ibb.co/WpQy5NL/hylnfuel.png](https://i.ibb.co/WpQy5NL/hylnfuel.png)

HYLN's powertrain also offers other advantages:

* Increases efficiency and reduces cost of gas for truckers by up to 35% (one of the biggest costs for trucking companies)
* Drastically increases pulling power up hills (time is money, dongus)
* Software uses machine learning that optimizes driving patterns, introducing further savings
* Eliminates need for idling vehicle when truckers are staying overnight in the cabin with a couple of ""friends of the road""

I can hear you now: ""*But I like Tesla because that's what the attractive people on CNBC told me to like!""*

Tesla is pretty cool. But you know what else is cool?

*A* [*fucking battery*](https://i.ibb.co/NY8xcTT/hylnbattery.png) *that can recharge in 8 minutes, lasts 5x as long as conventional EV batteries, and is so safe that you can* ***shoot a fucking bullet and not worry about it exploding***\*.\*

You hear that sound?

*RING... RING...*

""Hello, who's there?""

""Yes, this is the US Military, and we would like to take your fucking stonk to $100 a share, please.""

**Key takeaway:**

Hyliion's powertrains will be an extremely important bridge for the transition from dirty diesel to hydrogen/electric powered vehicles. Hyliion's product will be able to run on hydrogen in the future. Hyliion has the most badass battery out there, and can be used for military and commercial purposes. HYLN's got ya bases covered, boy.

# Financials: Green Giant (Dick)

Hyliion is currently valued at 1.65b. It currently has 650m in the fucking *cash*. This means that the company is valued at less than 3x its current cash holdings. It's a sneeze away from being priced at bankruptcy value. So why is it valued so low? High debt? Burning through cash? Insiders selling? Bad news?

Fucking **nah**. None of those.

For starters, HYLN used some of its cash reserves to extinguish all of its debt last quarter. It currently has **no fucking debt**. That must be why Wall St hates the stock so much: Wall St really likes stocks that take out a shitton of debt so that they can help the company issue additional shares and dilute the stock and fuck over shareholders and allow bankers to pocket tidy sums. **No debt is good for the company**. **It's great for shareholders.** **Bankers hate this one simple trick**.

Now, it's true Hyliion had a negative earnings last quarter of -0.13. So, for every share, HYLN lost 13 cents over the quarter. Know what else had a negative EPS? Fucking *Amazon* in 2014. This shit doesn't matter to HYLN. They only lost 32m last year. They would have to lose that same amount every single year for 20 years -- and then not qualify for any loans -- before they want bankrupt. Not to mention that this 32m they lost last year factors in the debt that they paid off, so future losses should be even smaller! That shit is just unfathomable. They're a **growth** company. This year is when they're **supposed to** lose money. So when do they start making money? They're projecting 2b in revenue in 2024 -- y'know, *more than the entire market cap of the company currently.* Can you say ""undervalued""? I know it's a lot of syllables, so maybe ask your wife's private male yoga instructor to coach you through it.

# Hyliion and The News -- Why Good is Bad and Why Bad is Nonexistant:

Hyliion recently released two extremely positive pieces of news for the company:

1. The revolutionary EV battery
2. Formation of the Hypertruck Council

I already talked about the battery. The stock popped 70% after this press release and has since drastically sold off.

The formation of the Hypertruck Council is goddamn massive. Basically, HYLN assembled a group of industry leaders in logistics and trucking to help inform them of the best way to move the ERX towards mass commercialization. They'll be providing feedback, suggesting changes, conducting testing, and, presumably, eventually purchase their vehicles if they like what they see. And I'm not talking about some rinky-dink companies. I'm talking real Big Dick Boys with over a hundred thousand trucks that could potentially use HYLN's hypertruck. To name just a few: Agility Logistics, American Natural Gas, Wegmans Food Markets, Anheuser-Busch. You know that last one! They make the shitty beer your cool friend Dave used to open with his forehead and drink foamy beer from when you were still a virgin in college. The stock popped 11% the morning it was announced, and closed the day at 0%. What the fuck.

Hyliion hasn't released any new negative news. Their path to profitability is the same as it has always been.

# Recent Insider Sales (Simple English: These are bad!)

None.

# Recent Insider Buys (Simple English: These are good!)

[300,000 shares over the past 3 months](https://preview.redd.it/fedm83x61us61.jpg?width=789&auto=webp&s=c3fc1c8aacc7a2987e91c9eb05bfc151fd2b275a)

Insiders must believe in the company, otherwise they wouldn't be buying shares for MUCH higher than HYLN's current trading price.

&#x200B;

So, given all of this good shit, why is the stock red? Let's finally get to the meat and plums of this thing:

# HYLN Stock: redder than your crush's boyfriend's bed sheets on prom night

HYLN is down 83% from its all-time highs. By any metric, it was overvalued at ATHs. However, it's down 34% in the past month alone, and 63% in the past 6 months, when it was trading at a not unreasonable valuation for a growth stock. It's currently [oversold](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/hyliion-holdings-is-now-oversold-hyln-2021-04-12), and trading below its long-term floor of $10. It's actually below the price that initial investors paid for the company when SHLL completed its acquisition of HYLN.

In fact, **every single person who has ever bought the stock (before today) is currently in the red.** And yet, the stock only has a daily [short volume of around 20%](https://i.ibb.co/C2XNDzR/hylnshortvol.png). How is this even *possible*? I think even you chimp-brains know the answer:

**Manipulation.**

[This article from GripRoom](https://www.griproom.com/fun/10-signs-your-stock-is-being-manipulated) lists 10 different signs that a stock is being manipulated. HYLN fulfills 9/10. The only one it doesn't fulfill is #5: ""Bad news shaves off more market cap than it should"" -- because there wasn't *been* any bad news lately. Replace ""Bad news"" with ""Good news"" and we have a perfect score of 10/10.

# How HYLN is being manipulated

Mark Delaney, an analyst for Goldman Sachs with a commendable rating of 1000 out of 7000 analysts, and an average annual return of Roughly The Market Average Over The Past Ten Years % (according to [TipRankings](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/mark-delaney)), recently downgraded that stock to $9 a share. This was after downgrading the stock to $11 a share just two months prior. Once again, I must reiterate that there has been **no negative news for HYLN** during these past two months, and only very positive news. The same day he issued a Sell rating for HYLN, he issued a Buy target for Lordstown Motors (RIDE) with a price target 100% higher than its current trading price. He issued this Buy rating despite RIDE currently being [under investigation by the SEC](https://www.wfmj.com/story/43555603/lordstown-motors-knew-of-sec-investigation-month-before-public-announcement) for fraud by misleading investors about [preorders, and other material information](https://www.autonews.com/automakers-suppliers/firm-exposed-nikola-calls-lordstown-motors-mirage).

So why is GS downgrading HYLN, and upgrading a company under investigation for fraud? It could have something to do with this:

>Lordstown CEO Steve Burns and DiamondPeak CEO David Hamamoto will sit on the combined company's board.  
>  
>Goldman Sachs is the exclusive financial adviser and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP is the legal adviser to DiamondPeak, while Goldman Sachs is serving as exclusive placement agent on the PIPE offering.

In other words, Goldman Sachs:

* helped RIDE list on the major exchanges
* got paid to provide ""financial advice"" to the blank check company that acquired RIDE
* **has it in their financial interest to pump the stock in spite of fundamentals**

Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs continues to downgrade HYLN while acquiring shares:

How credible is GS? I mean, they downgraded NIO to ""Sell"" July 17, 2020:

>Due to Goldman Sachs's downgrade on July 17, NIO stock gave up 14 percent of its gains

This was the lowest the stock has been since that day. The stock has risen over 240% since then. [Just read this article.](https://marketrealist.com/2020/07/goldman-sachs-downgrades-nio-stock/) It's fucking hilarious. Another choice quote:

>On June 2, Goldman Sachs upgraded NIO from neutral to buy. Then, 22 days later, the analyst downgraded the stock from buy to neutral based on its valuation. He downgraded NIO again 25 days later.

You could fucking right a book on this shit:

*From Neutral to Buy, and Back Again: How to Cuck Retail Traders in Just 50 Days!*

**These guys are fucking crooks.**

Another example. GS issued a [Buy rating for TSLA](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/goldman-sachs-upgrades-tesla-and-says-the-stock-has-massive-upside-of-over-30percent.html) on Dec 2, 2020. Six days later, they announced [an additional share offering with TSLA](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/08/tesla-to-raise-up-to-5-billion-in-share-offering.html). In other words, they pumped the stock so they could make more cocaine money from the share issuance.

So if you still haven't figured out why GS downgraded HYLN, let me spell it out for you: it's the same game that Wall Street always plays:

1. Rate the stock a ""Sell""
2. Watch price go down
3. Buy a bunch of shares
4. Wait for stock to rise drastically
5. Go back to step 1

I mean really, who are you going to trust -- some suit-wearing chud who's only up 16% YoY in a market that's up 50% YoY, and whose only experience with heavy-duty batteries is replacing the ones in his wife's overused vibrator -- or an [actual trucker](https://shorturl.at/dqDF9) who knows the ins and outs of the trucking industry?

I quote:

>“I know about truck driving. I know what trucking companies are looking for. I know what this type of product needs to be able to provide in order to be viable to the market. I know how truck drivers think. I know a lot about this industry. I’ve been doing this for a long time.”

Yeah, I think when I want to know about trucking, I'll probably go with the guy who pisses in bottles and collects VDs from all over the country, rather than the guy whose only experience with 18-wheelers was holding his wife's hand and telling her how pretty she looked while she filmed a scene for [TitsNTruckers.com](https://TitsNTruckers.com)

# Other sus sentiment manipulation

AKA how to turn rocket emojis into fear emojis:

1. [Brand new account made only to trash HYLN](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hyliion/comments/mpqsce/no_insider_sold/gucn1pz/?context=3)
2. [This account is dead now](https://stocktwits.com/jshetty720), but the guy used to post 8 hours a day, every single day, exclusively Bearish posts about HYLN, using entirely and only emotional language. That's... that's not someone who's doing that for free.

Plenty of examples of this if you spend enough time on Stocktwits.

I wouldn't be surprised if the stock dropped below $10 to take out some stop losses and encourage selling in people promoting the ""If it breaks $10, there really is no floor!!!"" narrative, before bouncing summarily back above $10 and trending upwards again. But this part is pure speculation.

# Competent Management Team

These are some of management's heavy hitters:

Thomas Healy -- Founder and CEO -- made Forbes' ""30 under 30"" 2 years ago. Healy's a no-nonsense engineer. He's not a pump man, and he knows his stock is a longterm investment. HYLN is his third start-up, and he's been working on it since 2015.

Patrick Sexton -- Chief Technology Officer -- Served as Director of Engineering in Powertrain Innovations at Dana Incorporated for 6 years. This guy fucking *knows shit, and stuff*. AND he even has *Sex* in his name. He has a *ton* of *Sex* in his name. If that doesn't make you Bullish, I don't know what will.

Andy Card --  on the Board of Directors -- Former transportation secretary and WH Chief of Staff under George W. Bush. This is kinda, yknow, *the exact sort of guy you want working as a corporate director for your company*.

Sherri Baker -- CFO -- Worked with Dean Foods for 8 years and Frito Lay for 10 years.

# Finishing statements

I know a lot of y'all got burned by HYLN before, probably buying in at $50 a share like a bunch of retards. However, you have to ask yourself: do you like the *stock*, or do you like the *hype?* If it's the latter, then I recommend waiting until the stock is at $70 and buy in right before Mark Delaney downgrades the stock to $20 or something retarded. If it's the former, do your research, ask questions, and then throw your hands in the air and say ""Fuck it! It's too complicated!"" and go ask your fucking fortune teller what you should do.

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

On their exchange it was trading a tokenized version for $600 which was approx $150B marketcap.  Realistically anything $350 or beyond is speculation as it’ll be priced beyond perfection.  So how to make money...?

A rising tide lifts all boats.  Two companies in same space are flying under the radar, Bakkt ($v i h) and eToro ($f t c v).  Marketcap are right now $3B and $14b.  

Bakkt is fully regulated, majority owned by ICE/NYSE (owns 76%), Steven Cohen owns 5.6%, and has 3.3 million shares short which could trigger a squeeze today through end of week if this gets volume today.  Fully regulated, started by selling futures on b1tcoin, and just launched their retail digital wallet. Who says digital wallets are the future?  Mama Woods: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/13/cathie-wood-sees-these-2-trends-as-the-next-big-things-after-electric-vehicles.html

EToro is a platform to buy/sell crypt0 and stocks.  It’s focus is in Europe and just expanding into US now.  Their revenue is about 1/3 the size of $Coin but it’s marketcap could be as small as 1/10 of $coin (depends where $coin goes today).  Robinhood wants to ipo at $50B and eToro is same size.  Again a high volume day here as a sympathy play could result in big gains rest of week.  If people don’t want to put $350 into $coin they are going to look for next best thing.  I think a lot of them will land here.  

Imo both of these will run today and rest of week.  I would not be surprised at all to see either one double by week’s end.  Glta."

1618361282.0,18,Visualizing Option Data Across the Meme Stocks and ETFs,"**Why?**

Since most of you can't read, I've gone ahead and plotted the entire option chain across several meme stocks and commonly mentioned tickers on WSB. This way, you can just look at pictures of actual interesting data, instead of useless stupid triangles.

I personally find the general shape of options prices and implied volatility really fascinating. I am doing with this with the aim of learning:

1. How much of the general price structure is dictated by pricing models (black-scholes, bi-nomial etc), and how much purely by supply and demand (what is the structure of implied volatility, IV).
2. How much are the general spread of options prices disrupted here by degenerate gabblers on reddit?
3. How much is the feedback of 1 into 2, or vice-versa?
4. How much, and where are people/algos making bets?

Another thing that plotting all this data gives you is a much better understanding of why options take on the greek values that they do. I am still working on calculating greek/derivative values, but data quality is a hurdle there.

I've put the plots on imgur, since there are too many tickers to embed in a reddit post:

**Option Prices**

Plotted as Ask price with the spread visualized by bubble size.

**Implied Volatility**

1618356168.0,130,"Betting on Oil, Gas, and Economic Growth","So, this is my first DD post.  Hopefully I do it right, and I'm sure if I don't, ya'll let me know in the comments.

Basically, I'm placing a big bet on Oil going up, and on US Gasoline prices going up.  The two are related, but not the same.

First, the Oil bet.  Oil prices generally go up when economic activity goes up, it's used for cars, boats, planes, power generation, and a bunch of other stuff like making plastic.  Oil is also a very price inelastic commodity, either you need it or you don't, and it takes a big swing in the price to make you change your mind.  This means excesses and shortages can have outsize influence on the price - for example, the price of oil going negative last year for a little bit.

The pandemic is ending because vaccines are going out to people like crazy, and once people get them, everybody wants to go out and do everything they haven't been able to do for a year and change now.  Yeah, there are new variants, and yeah, Europe and India just got hit with new lockdowns, but those aren't going to last, and the vaccine factories are running full tilt.  Even before vaccines when we had the Spanish Flu in 1918, the thing burned itself out after a year.  Also, we're getting into the summer months, which means more sunlight and heat, and people being outside, all of which are bad for COVID.  Anybody remember how case counts drastically dropped last summer?  Now combine that same drop plus all the people who've had it or are vaccinated.

This summer the developed world is going to see a spike of economic growth like it hasn't seen since the end of WWII.  2nd and 3rd quarter growth projections are as high as 8% in some forecasts, know what we're going to need to power that kind of growth?  Oil.  For ships to move all those goods from China and Vietnam and Taiwan to America.  For ships to move empty containers back to China.  For airplanes to handle massive increases in air freight because we already have a huge backlog in shipping.  For airplanes to move tourists to resorts and islands and to see family again.  For trucks to move all those goods from ports to stores.  For delivery vans to move all those goods from warehouses to homes.  For cars to take families out to eat or to go on vacation.  For cars for all the people who discover their boss is a dick and wants them back in the office.  For cars for all the workers who need to go back to work at restaurants and stores again.  For peak demand power plants to provide electricity for air conditioning all those buildings that are full of people during the summer. Cruise ships full of old people, you get the idea.

Most analyst estimates on air travel use are based off of patterns from the air travel recovery from 9/11.  I think that's stupidly wrong because people kept getting re-scared about flying every couple months when some dumbass Saudi would get caught with shoe or underwear bombs.  The post COVID decision tree is simpler: Vaccinated?  No - stay the fuck home.  Yes - get ur ass to a beach and party.  Jet fuel usage is also going to skyrocket much faster than expected because of increased air freight due to all the supply line fuckery that's been happening, eventually, they give up on the boats and just fly that shit for 20x the price.

Now for some numbers.  In March 2021, the world used 96 million barrels of oil a day.  The US EIA projects 2021 demand at 97.6 million barrels a day at an average price of $65/barrel.   That prediction is frankly asinine.  The USA alone will use more than 1.6 million barrels a day more in June than it did in March.  (for reference, last August, the EIA predicted 2021 usage of 91.1 million barrels a day, they're great at tracking production levels, predicting usage, not so much their thing)  In 2019 the world used 99.7 million barrels a day.  We're probably going noticeably over 100 mbd this summer due to pent up demand.  So, if we have a big demand surge, that means a big price surge, yeah?  It does!  But wait, there's more!

You really can't talk about oil production without talking about politics, and politics actually favor supply having trouble ramping up fast enough to meet demand.  While google says there are about 9 mbd of excess supply, there really aren't.  First, 2 mbd of that is Iranian oil waiting to be freed up by sanctions.  Pretending that oil isn't already in circulation is a polite fiction.  The Chinese and Indians buy it up by the boatload.  Another 2 mbd of oil has already been added to global supplies by the latest OPEC+ meeting reducing their quotas (1 mbd of that coming in June is from Saudi Arabia and is probably MBS's penance for murdering Kashoggi, Sleepy Joe is old enough to remember the 70's oil shock and doesn't want another one fucking up his recovery)

Now, of the remaining 5 mbd, 2 mbd of that is US production that's unlikely to come back online because of changes to US regulatory stances since Biden took office.  This means that unlike in 2014 to 2019 where the USA was the swing supplier, we don't have millions of barrels of capacity to turn on at a moments notice.  That leaves 3 mbd, which added to the 2mbd OPEC+ has put in, plus the 96 mbd we're producing right now, means that we top out at 101 mbd of production, which basically means zero margin for error this summer, which means higher prices.

Now we get into the politics.  African and Venezuelan production is dropping because of decades of mismanagement and graft, and they have a lot of trouble attracting outside expertise because of nationalizations and kidnappings in the past.  In the middle east, you've got the ongoing proxy war between KSA and Iran.  Remember a couple months ago when the Houthis hit a Saudi oil facility with drones and cruise missiles?  The Houthis are some hard as fuck nomadic desert tribesmen, but they don't have drones and cruise missiles, - the Iranians do.  At any point MBS doing something really stupid to trigger a bigger fight with the Iranians is always a strong possibility - remember this is the guy who thought up the whole ""dress a guy in Kashoggis clothes and have him walk around Turkey in front of cameras"" plot, (and thought there was no way they'd get caught because Erdogan, who hates the Saudis, would never bug their embassy, right?), smart and strategic aren't exactly his bread and butter.  Right now the Saudi's just hit India with a big rate hike on oil, and the Indians responded by buying more from Iran.  That's something to keep an eye on.

And finally, we get to Russia.  Uncle Joe recently gave an interview where he said he told Putin to his face that he had no soul, and Putin punked out and agreed with him.  Vlad's a guy who's so obsessed with his tough guy image he fights in staged cage matches while in his 60s among numerous, numerous other stunts including deep sea diving and tigers.  The initial response was to pull the Russian ambassador from DC.  Back in the cold war that level of reaction would be a prelude to tanks massing in the Fulda Gap and everyone going to DEFCON 5, today it doesn't even rate a mention on CNN.  Vlad's going to be looking HARD for a way to fuck over Biden this summer, escalations in the middle east and Afghanistan, or fucking us on energy prices are his best options.

2nd, we have the case for US gasoline.  This is similar to the case for oil, but with some added twists.  When oil goes up, so does gas, because it's made from the stuff.  Simple, right?  But there's more.  Remember that big storm in Texas that froze all the wind turbines and made puts on power companies print?  Yeah, so it also damaged the hell out of a large number of the remaining refineries in the US, and they're just finally getting fixed.  That's why US crude stocks are rising, because the refineries can't work to turn it into gas.  We've avoided a big hit to gas prices so far by bringing in all the excess gasoline from Europe (their big remaining stocks are all diesel, which even they don't really want after the VW mess), and currently we're taking all the refined oil out of Asia.  Once that excess is dried up, if the refineries take another hit, we are, in a word, fuxed.  If said refineries DO get back to working on their backlog before the world's excess supply is run through, well, guess what, we're going into post pandemic hype season, which coincides with the biggest driving season... and there are no excess supplies of refined gas available to meet demand spikes.  Know what that means?  Higher prices for drivers and tendies for us.

So, those are the bull cases, now it's time for the bad news bear cases.

1. **More Pandemic.**  The Chinese fuck up and another COVID escapes from one of their labs again.  RIP worldwide recovery, RIP SPY, hello permanent lockdowns 4 life.  The hedge here is DRIP calls, VIX calls, SPXS/SPXU calls and SPY puts.
2. **Rainbow Triumph.**  Somehow everyone manages supply vs. demand perfectly, there's no geopolitical drama and oil trades sideways at $60-65/barrel for the rest of the year.  The refineries along the gulf coast and in Texas never have any problems for the rest of the year, lots of excess driving doesn't happen and gasoline trades sideways. No real way to hedge this, you just kinda get fucked on the trade.  This scenario is incredibly unlikely, but I figure it's worth mentioning because, just like \[exceedingly improbably event\], it IS theoretically possible.
3. **Too much Jed Clampett.**  Oil supply drastically overshoots demand and energy prices crater.  The hedge is DRIP calls.
4. **Margin Call the Movie.**  There are a bunch more Bill Hwang and Archegos capitals out there and they blow up the world economy with a bet on gourd futures that contagion spreads to everything, leading to mass layoffs and killing the economy.  The hedge is DRIP calls, VIX calls, SPXS/SPXU calls, and SPY puts.
5. **Triumph of the Apes.** I can't believe I have to list this as a serious global economic risk, but if the Apes are right, and the GME MOASS happens, a lot of hedge funds are going to go belly up, leading to the same scenario as #4.  The hedge is DRIP calls, VIX calls, and SPY puts.
6. **Lockdown Slowdown.**  The slight upticks in new variant Corona we're seeing in India, Europe, and Japan significantly slow reopening and push the big demand surge back a couple months.  The hedge is buying calls farther out.
7. **One Eyed Genius.**  Michael Burry is right about Weimar Republic inflation hitting this summer.  The hedge is do nothing, you're already long on commodities, which is an inflation hedge.  Go take a couple wheelbarrows of your cash and buy a loaf of bread.
8. **2008 2.0.**  This one's kind of a wildcard nuclear bomb for the US, but it's a possibility.  At some point, currently June, the Eviction/Foreclosure moratorium will end, a LOT of properties will go on the market at once at fire sale prices, because banks and mortgage companies don't want to own houses, they want to own debt, - potentially crashing the US housing market, which is frankly super inflated/bubbly right now.  The date of the program ending probably just ends up getting kicked down the road, but if you're long on literally anything this is something to keep an eye on.  Same hedges as most of the above, go long on stuff that inverses the market.

Some other random stuff I've come across while researching this:  Goldman has an $80/barrel price target for Q3.  They recently raised it from $75/barrel.  They're a bunch of lying fucks, so I actually view this as either bullish in that they're setting up their clients to get into this late, or bearish in that they're a bunch of lying fucks.

JP Morgan says oil trades sideways all summer at $65-70, because of extra COVID and Iranian production coming online.  I really can't take the concept of ""extra"" Iranian oil that's being stopped by sanctions seriously.

Oxford also just announced they see oil trading sideways all summer, but with spikes from $54 to $75.  This is definitely possible, and why I plan to take profits aggressively until I've at least broken even on the trade.

Option interest on OTM calls for a lot of the tickers I've looked at is crazy high.  Like, even higher than you'd expect if someone was just hedging a position.  There's a fair amount of sentiment and money behind the idea that oil is going up in the summer and fall.

Most of the analyst types view the real pickup in oil as happening later in the year, in Q3 and Q4. I'm going with July because everything about this pandemic economic cycle has been accelerated, and I'm more looking for a temporary demand spike to cash in on than a long term investment opportunity.

Don't rely on charts for past price information on anything w/regard to oil.  Every ETF that tracks oil had a reverse split last spring when oil went negative.  Also, they don't track the price directly, they track percent changes, and it's not always perfect, so if it trades sideways they can drop, and if it runs they can outgain it or underperform it, depending.

UPDATE: I wrote this over a week and a half, and since I started it, the Houthi's have hit another Saudi facility, Russia massed troops on Ukraine's border, China is starting a fight with the Philippines, Israel hit Iran's nuclear facility (sabotage, not aircraft) and JNJ Vaccine got suspended in the US.  Gonna be a wild summer.  Everyone is pent up and pissed off from lockdowns.  Take advantage of spikes and dips.

Ok so here's some tickers for you to throw money at:

For Oil we've got **BNO** \- which tracks Brent Crude, **DBO** \- which tracks WTI, **USO** \- which tracks WTI and some gasoline and heating oils and other fuels in the US, and **GUSH** \- which is a leveraged fund that tracks oil and gas.

For Gasoline we've got **UGA** \- which tracks US gasoline prices.

UGA is the biggest profit making ticker here.  It hasn't ever had any kind of split, reverse or otherwise, so you can use charts on it, and the last time gas was over $3, it was running in the $50-$60 range.  Right now it's at $31, and July and Oct $40+ calls are pennies.  Open interest on these is in the thousands.  If gas goes over $4/gallon, look out above.  Currently the spot price for gas is just under $2.  (note, the price of gas we're talking about here is NOT what you're paying at the corner station)

To help everyone out with price targets, here are my (guesstimated, I made these projections myself, don't trust them, they're what I used to decide where to put money, and I'm down overall on the year)

Brent Price        BNO Price         WTI Price      DBO Price        USO Price

65                        16.50                  65                  11.60                 44.50

70                        17.60                  70                  12.60                 48.10

75                        18.90                  75                  13.55                 51.40

80                        20.15                  80                  14.25                 54.70

90                        22.75                  90                  16.15                 61.45

100                     25.20                  100                 18.00                 68.50

Again, these aren't perfect, they're rough guidelines/guesstimates, emphasis on the guess, I made them using the calculator on my phone.  It's not science.

My positions, their cost basis, and what I'll make at various price points (I've been building some of these for awhile, so my costs may not reflect current market prices):

**Bull positions:**

*BNO* Calls                                *DBO* Calls                        *USO* Calls

10x  7/16 17c (1.05)               10x  7/16 11c (0.65)       5x  7/16 43c (2.07)

10x  7/16 18c  (0.45)                                                        5x  7/16 45c (1.35)



*GUSH* Calls                             *UGA* Calls

4x   9/17 130c (2.3)                5x   7/16 35c (1.18)

20x    7/16 40c (0.44)

**Bear Positions:**

*DRIP* Calls                             *UVXY* Calls                          *SPXS* Calls

1x 9/17 20c (1.30)                2x 6/18 7c (0.70)                3x 7/16 40c (1.20)

I'll be adding to these positions until the end of April when I close out most of my remaining positions or until Oil goes over $65, whichever comes first.  Probably adding some DBO 12c's, and some 10/15 UGA 40c's.  Might switch it up.  I'll post updates at the start of every month.

When it comes to exit strategy, I'll be paperhanding the fuck out of stuff as prices rise until I'm even on what I've put in here.  Especially on the more OTM calls.  After that I'm looking for temporary spikes between $80 and $100 to unload.

TL;DR:  Motherfuckers want to get the fuck outta the house and go spend like drunken sailors, that means more monkeys burn black gogo juice, price go up, cost more bananas

BlackRock Fund Advisors 14,174,839 03/31/2021

Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC 10,840,813

03/31/2021

FMR Inc 9,276,087 12/31/2020

Fidelity Management and Research Company 9,276,087

12/31/2020

BlackRock Inc 9,217,335 616,828 12/31/2020

&#x200B;

Notice anything strange? there are 2 Blackrock and 3 Fidelity management in the account but let's break down the numbers. I would like to start by analyzing Fidelity:

Fidelity as we know sold its 9,276,000 shares on January 29, 2021, remaining with only 87 shares.

Source : [https://www.wsj.com/articles/fidelity-cashes-in-most-of-gamestop-stake-11612980430](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fidelity-cashes-in-most-of-gamestop-stake-11612980430)

Average user : But the media is lying to us about all the data against gme !!!

ok let's go directly to analyze the 13G/A SEC filing on 2021-02-08:

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000315066/000031506621001050/filing.txt](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000315066/000031506621001050/filing.txt)

Here it is stated that FMR LLC owns 9,276,087 shares of GME as of 12/31/2020.

Now let's analyze the 13g/A SEC filing filed 2 days later 2021-02-10:

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000315066/000031506621001389/filing.txt](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000315066/000031506621001389/filing.txt)

Here it is attested that as of January 29, FMR LLC owns only 87 shares and has sold 9,276,000 shares.

it is a bit strange that both FMR LLC and Fidelity Management and Research company have the same shares don't you think?

Even if you wanted to dispute that they are still the same company but one a branch of the other, try looking for an SEC 13G/A or 13F or 13D filing of either company. Save yourself the time, you won't find anything, I've already searched. And if you want to search, always compare the company's Central Index Key ""The Central Index Key  is used on the SEC's computer systems to identify corporations and individual people who have filed disclosures with the SEC.""

&#x200B;

Now let's move on to the famous Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC which owns a whopping 10,840,813 shares.

The update is dated 3/31/2021. I have really searched every corner of the SEC website, every single company with the name Fidelity to look for this blessed Filing 13/G stating that Fidelity purchased 10m shares but alas, I have found nothing. By the way I would like to point out that there was a Change of -9,039,884 shares. Therefore it is assumed that the shares were 19,880,697.

The question arises: since there was a change, where is the filing that attests that fidelity owned 19,880,697 shares?

Knowing for a fact that fidelity was left with only 87 shares, in order to buy 19m shares you must have filed a Form 13D or 13G (The difference between a Schedule 13D and Schedule 13G is pretty clear: are you an activist shareholder or not. ). Let's say it's a ""different"" Fidelity, it still has to file a 13G or 13D. For those who do not know what a 13G and 13D form is, I refer you to investopedia which summarizes what is written on the official website of the SEC:

Source 13G: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/schedule13g.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/schedule13g.asp)

Source 13D: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/schedule13d.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/schedule13d.asp)

Differences between 13G and 13D: [https://www.prosek.com/unboxed-thoughts/another-difference-between-d-and-g-is-more-than-just-the-obvious/](https://www.prosek.com/unboxed-thoughts/another-difference-between-d-and-g-is-more-than-just-the-obvious/)

The 13G or D must be posted within 10 days of the position opening. Assuming the position was opened on 3/31/2021, they should publish the 13D or G filing tomorrow 4/14/2021.

If tomorrow they publish the Filing that attests that Fidelity has 10,840,813 shares, there would still be an open question: there has been a change of -9,039,884, where is the Filing that attests that Fidelity has bought 19,880,697?

Now the same reasoning made for Fidelity is applied to Blackrock Inc.

We know for a fact that Blackrock Inc owns 9,217,335 shares (updated 12/31/2020) via the 13G Filing issued on 2021-01-26:

Source: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001364742/000083423721001340/us36467w1099\_012621.txt](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001364742/000083423721001340/us36467w1099_012621.txt)

What is surprising is that Blackrock Fund Advisors owns 14,174,839 shares as of 3/31/2021. Again there was a Change which in this case is -364,635 shares.

As with Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC, there is no record of the purchase of these shares on the SEC website. Again, one has to wait until tomorrow (4/14/2021) to see if Blackrock really did purchase this number of shares. But again, the usual question asked for Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC remains: If you take the data to be true and there was a Change of -364,635, where is the previous filing that finds that Blackrock owns 14,174,839 + 364,635 = 14,539,478 shares?

Some might say: what if they had drafted a 13F instead? they have 45 days. Well, if they had filed a 13F, which, as we recall (Each filing is due within 45 days after the end of the calendar quarter, i.e., the calendar quarters that end on March 31), it should have already been published.

Assuming that the quarter is not the one that ended in December but the one that ends in March, how is it possible that there is a change of a position before the original position is published?

Conclusions

The %shares held by institutions of Finra cannot be taken into consideration and considered true because:

\- As we have seen the positions of the same companies i.e. FMR Inc and Fidelity Management and Research Company are counted several times.

\- The position of the latter was closed on January 29 and therefore Finra is considering positions that no longer exist.

 \- For those who want to believe the fairy tale of the transfer of ownership through ITEM 7 I just say go check out the other 13Gs

EXAMPLE:

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000315066/000031506619001099/filing.txt](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000315066/000031506619001099/filing.txt)

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000315066/000031506617001695/filing.txt](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000315066/000031506617001695/filing.txt)

I took 2 at random, they all have the fucking wording : ""

Item 7. Identification and Classification of the Subsidiary Which

Acquired the Security Being Reported on By the Parent Holding Company.

"" and

""Exhibit A

Pursuant to the instructions in Item 7 of Schedule 13G,

the following table lists the identity and Item 3 classification, if

applicable, of each relevant entity that beneficially owns shares of the

security class being reported on this Schedule 13G.""

Opening every 13G there is this wording, following the reasoning Fidelity likes to pass shares in every fucking 13G xD

For Blackrock the same reasoning applies, tomorrow we will discover if the same error made for Fidelty of the ""duplicates"" will be the same also for Blackrock. Certainly, if tomorrow 13G is published, it will be an update of Blackrock's position which will go from 9m to 14m shares and therefore the duplication will have to be eliminated from the account.

I conclude by saying that FINRA cannot afford to make such serious mistakes.

My opinion: In my opinion nothing will be published tomorrow but I am ready to change my mind. I believe that Bloomberg's data are the ones to refer to. Not for nothing you pay 25k a year. But again it's just my opinion.

UPDATE: No new 13G/D has been released so the positions in the screen are completely wrong. The only real position is that of Black Rock Inc which owns 9,217,335 shares.

Here I wrote another DD with additional explanations about Black Rock Inc and Black Rock Fund Advisor : [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mr29pc/additional\_explanations\_to\_my\_gme\_counter\_dd\_why/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mr29pc/additional_explanations_to_my_gme_counter_dd_why/)

EDIT:  User u/AlexandbroTheGreat pointed out to me that he had also written a similar post, I attach a comment from him:

This is an automatically generated page that has fucked up data. The two Fidelity's and FMR are the same company. Same with the two BlackRocks. Additionally the disclosures are only a snapshot. In other words, the same shares could be double, triple, or quadruple counted."

Before I reading, I just want to express that predictions and dates should not be taken as absolute and that these are just my opinions on what COULD be coming. I am also well aware that correlation does not equal causation and that these correlations could be coincidences, so please don't comment that, these are just my thoughts based on research that I've done. I've done many posts on GME and these are all my personal opinions based on my research, so do not take them as fact. This is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor.

There's been an onslaught of news regarding GME in the past few weeks and days, and I believe that there is more to come and that because of that the squeeze is inevitable and in the near future.

\- GME announcing the search for new C.E.O.

\- GME paying off senior notes (today)

\- The announcement of GME's right/intention to sell 3.5M shares or $1B in value (this may not seem important but I'll explain why it's crucial later)

\- The announcement of the definitive date for the annual meeting (6/9 lmao)

**Why it matters:**

The past two weeks have been bombarded with news from GME, and almost all of it deals with leadership or the transformation. I believe that this bombardment of news is extremely intentional. The reason that I believe this is because of their announcement of the right to sell those shares. When GME made this announcement, the stock was at $190. GME knew full and well that anytime an announcement like this happens, the market would react negatively to the stock, and, because GME is so volatile and the victim of abusive shorting, that negative reaction could've been huge. Despite knowing this, they decided not to sell at that moment. I deduce from that lack of action that GME believes that the stock will go WELL ABOVE that $190 level sometime in the future because if they really wanted to capture the value of the stock at $190, they would've just sold the shares instead of reserving the right to do so. With that being said, I believe that they are actively trying to set up the stock for a massive run that could potentially trigger a squeeze so that they can capitalize on a price that is well above $190. If this wasn't their plan, then it made zero sense that they didn't just sell at $190 knowing that the announcement would tank the stock, which it did. Finally, when almost every analyst (boomers) says that GME is grossly overvalued, it is irresponsible of you as a corporation not to take advantage of that extremely elevated share price unless.... you have reason to believe that it will soon be substantially higher. Therefore, I believe that the recent slew of announcements is their attempt to make that happen and that we should see more announcements in the near future because they are probably well aware that being lax about this could lead to decreased interest in the stock.

To add to this, GME has repeatedly warned in their S.E.C. filings that suspect shorting activity on the stock could cause it to squeeze (they have said this twice since the original squeeze). This, to me, seems that they are covering themselves so that they can't get sued for market manipulation if it does indeed squeeze. What's even more interesting about this is that maybe they have data that is not available to apes and other primates that suggests that the shorting activity is even more abusive than any of us thought (again just a theory).

**Catalyst**

But what could the next announcement be? It's very difficult to actually know. The paying off of the senior notes caught me by surprise but isn't news that would actually propel the stock to the stratosphere. I believe that their next catalyst will be something about either the C.E.O. position or the digital transformation. GME could very well announce Cohen as the C.E.O., which would undoubtedly send the stock to the stratosphere. They could also announce something about an acquisition or something related to their shift to e-commerce. Again, this is simply conjecture, but I believe that GME is going to make some kind of catalyst announcement soon to push up the price. However, the biggest and most crucial catalyst could be a share recall. First, I want to stress that GME itself cannot recall shares, only individual investors can do that. If only there was an investor with a ton of shares in GME who has an active interest in making the stock go higher and has tweeted cryptic messages about hating shorts and bears... oh wait. If Cohen or another whale with a high stake in GME announces a share recall, that could be the ultimate catalyst for us. Or, if the hiring of a new executive/board member requires a vote, an activist could do what Hestia did last year and recommend that all shareholders recall their shares (see my previous DD on that).

Personally, I thought that the Cohen news would propel us to the moon, but I guess not. Maybe that shows more proof that shorts are in really deep. 

**Timing**

The timing on the possible above-mentioned catalyst could not be more perfect. First, our lord and savior Mr. Gill's calls expire this Friday. At the same time, GME is forming what many are calling the mother of all wedges on extremely low volume (pictured below). The apex of the wedge should be this Thursday or Friday but could get pushed back to sometime next week if we still trade sideways. As many of you know, the options volume for this Friday is also through the roof as most of GME's monthly options are. What I'm hoping for is that GME announces some kind of catalyst in the coming week that will make a whale who is not invested in GME think ""wow the stock is consolidating in this giant wedge pattern and is relatively cheap... time for some chaos."" Finally, we have the 4/20 (lmao) deadline for shares to be recalled ahead of the annual meeting. I have trouble believing that GME is not going to do something before that deadline to trigger a price jump because, as I said previously, they have a vested interest in getting this above $190.

Here's the mother of all wedges that is actually forming with the mother of all cup and handles (yeah I know the cup and handle might be a stretch):

Finally, I also said in a previous post that GME is correlated extremely closely to the VIX. Many have said that it is inversely correlated with SPY, which seems to be true, but it is even more directly correlated with the VIX. This leads me to believe that GME does not move when the market is bad, but GME moves when the market is volatile (which usually happens when the market is bad). And, oh would you look at that, SPY is at $412 and is overbought and the VIX is at $16 (pre-pandemic levels). Looks like the market is thirsty for some nice volatility. For more on this, I encourage you to read ""the everything short"" post, which provides a much more in-depth analysis of how the market could crash and how GME relates to that.

Here are the charts. The first one is VIX and the second is SPY (both are the purple lines), as you can see, the VIX lines up extremely similarly with GME and SPY seems to be inverse to GME. This shows that GME does best when conditions are volatile or that GME creates volatile market conditions. As stated previously, the market is very overbought right now and there is very little volatility, so GME may soon be primed to change that or benefit from a change. The thing to get from this is that, based on GME's relationship to SPY and VIX, this is another indication that GME is in the perfect position to have a breakout as SPY is overbought and VIX is extremely low:

**Quick Note on Short interest**  

Just wanted to give my thoughts on the GME short interest. As you all know there are tons of different numbers on GME short interest. Most boomer websites say it's anywhere between 19%-50% which is still extremely high. Most apes say that it's over 100% at minimum. I personally believe that websites are correct because the data is being altered through ETF shorting, naked shorting, and synthetic longs (see other posts for more on this). Therefore, I believe that the true short interest is over 100%. It makes no sense that GME's borrow rate on iborrowdesk is below 2% with short interest being able 20% and available shares getting to below 100 at one point today. Also, based purely on logic, it doesn't make sense that if every boomer analyst thinks GME is grossly overvalued that they wouldn't short it, so there is no way that GME's short interest is anything below 50%. Therefore, I believe that they are indeed abusively shorting it but are using the above tactics in order to manipulate the data so that the true short interest isn't shown so that regulators and the media don't start getting suspicious. 

**Conclusion**

So, we have technicals lining up very nicely, a company with a vested interest in seeing the stock soar right now, a plethora of potential catalysts, a definitive date for when shares would need to be recalled, abusive shorting, a failure to deliver cycle, an insanely volatile stock that loves good news, a market that is thirsty for some volatility, and oh year one more thing.... some damn primates that refuse to sell. Stay strong, apes."
1618352054.0,203,PLTR YOLO. Sold shares to buy 70x 4/16 $25c,
1618351340.0,130,I Like NOK,"Ok apes this is not financial advice and it's my first time doing something like this so obviously just pass on by.   
I like NOK, I have liked their phones since the first shitty little flip came up and I even liked their little window phone. I believe 4$ for such stock is a buy and I want to list some reasons why.   


1. On their Capital Markets day in March, the company outlined their new approaches to the market, going as far to say they  ""Anticipate comparable operating margin to increase to 10–13% in 2023 and to grow faster than the market in full-year 2023""  
as part of this  Nokia sees a number of major trends impacting the industry over the next  few years, with 5G and resulting technologies at their core and  creating opportunities for CSPs, enterprises and webscales.     
Thus they are not only positioning to take advantage of Phones being in the market but diversifying enough to expect increases in cloud based and networks, hence their target being to build a satisfying and diverse network portfolio  

2. With the world getting more oriented towards what might be a closed off market, ie everyone becoming self sustaining, NOK is positioned to be a huge part of China's cloud based mobile deployment as outlined here [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nokia-nok-power-china-mobiles-124112852.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nokia-nok-power-china-mobiles-124112852.html)  
This would be a significant market to have front row access to and coupled with their sustainability goals, would provide affordable service right as the world is focusing on the cloud and improving internet services.   

3. Nokia has reached a settlement with Lenovo, with the latter paying the former and both agreeing to a cross licensing agreement over video compression patents. Lenovo IS THE WORLD'S TOP PC SELLER so this patent agreement is a boon for Nokia. [https://www.wraltechwire.com/2021/04/07/lenovo-pays-nokia-to-settle-patent-dispute-secures-cross-licensing-agreement/](https://www.wraltechwire.com/2021/04/07/lenovo-pays-nokia-to-settle-patent-dispute-secures-cross-licensing-agreement/)  

4. they believe in the strength of their own company and future plans as they are offering an equity based program to their staff that was approved by the board. [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/18/2177687/0/en/Nokia-Board-of-Directors-approved-the-Nokia-equity-program-for-2021-2023.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/18/2177687/0/en/Nokia-Board-of-Directors-approved-the-Nokia-equity-program-for-2021-2023.html)  ""Nokia seeks to recognize, reward and retain its most talented employees.  The long-term incentive plan intends to effectively contribute to the  long-term value creation and sustainability of the Company and align the  interests of the executives and employees with those of Nokia’s  shareholders.  ""  


The company is thinking long term, has a good position in the early market for 5g as well as a HUGE nation of people, focusing on retaining and treating their employees right, and might have some great patents to improve their products' impact.   
However, I am just a dumb ape who likes the stock. In the last couple weeks it has grown about 1% so clearly I expect it to be a long haul. It was also rumored to be one of the naked shorts from earlier so I don't exactly know if any hedgies have exited it yet, though them being dumber than us retards I doubt it. That's just my thought process. Thanks!"

The list goes on and on. The fact of the matter is people do stupid shit when greed takes over, and there's a frenzy, a rush to buy into the hype before everyone else. A lot of these ticker mixups can be owed to boomers calling their brokers (yes, how old-school) and just telling them to ""buy ZOOM"". Lol.

&#x200B;

Why does all of this shit matter? Because of the TuSimple IPO tomorrow. First off, TuSimple is going to skyrocket because they're building an autonomous freight network that'll dramatically lower costs in shipping. This company is potentially worth hundreds of billions. You can bet $SMPL will pop. 

&#x200B;

Great, you're still reading. Now guess what, $SMPL isn't going to be the TuSimple ticker. But if that got you for a second, then you understand what MCI-MCIC is all about. Buy $SMPL in advance of the IPO, because retards will surely confuse the two. This. Happens. Every. Fucking. Time. 

This is strictly +EV because worst case, you're holding a stock with some exposure to the overall market and no material news incoming this week that could kill the company's fundamentals. Best case, you have added buying pressure from retarded investors mistaking the tickers.

&#x200B;

TL;DR. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Buy $SMPL because the TuSimple IPO will provide a strong catalyst with the MCI-MCIC phenomenon. Don't wait to see the headlines this time, thinking ""shit, I missed that"".

The  company is Rust Street Interactive. RSI operates the #2 nationwide online casino in the nation, as well as the #3 or #4 online sports book in the country.



  
\*\*\*\*The company\*\*\*\*

RSI operates   [https://www.betrivers.com](https://www.betrivers.com/)  which is an online casino and sports book. 
They are now fully licensed and operating in:

New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Colorado, Iowa, Virginia, and West Virginia. 



  
\*\*\*\*The value\*\*\*\*

RSI has growth on pace with the king of gambling stocks DKNG. RSI is also guiding for 60% of the revenue of DKNG. Despite the amazing growth and guidance, RSI is trading close to 1/10th the market cap of DKNG. Based on their growth and future guidance, I would expect RSI to be trading closer to 1/2 the market cap of DKNG, or about $13.5 billion.   That is 4.3x higher than the current market cap which is at about $3.1 billion market cap. 

  
A quick comparison to SKLZ and DKNG below:

$SKLZ FY2021 Guidance = $366M w/ a market cap of $6.3B Forward PS = 17.2

$DKNG FY2021 Guidance = $950M w/ market cap $23.6B Forward PS = 24.8

$RSI FY2021 Guidance = $440M w/ Market cap $3.1B Forward PS = 7.0

Comparison of MAUs (Monthly active users) with DKNG

For RSI, Real-Money Monthly Active Users (MAUs) in the United States for the fourth quarter of 2020 were up 116% year-over-year and 22% sequentially from the third quarter, with average revenue per MAU (“ARPMAU”) of $328 during the fourth quarter of 2020. (ir.rushstreetinteractive.co/...) 

For DKNG: Average Revenue per MUP (“ARPMUP”) was $65 in the fourth quarter representing a 55% increase versus the same period in 2019. (draftkings.gcs-web.com/news...)  RSI has plenty of room to grow and capture even more market share and their customers are spending about 5x as much as DKNG. I like my prospects with RSI 


\*\*\*\*The finanacials\*\*\*\*

RSI crushed Q4 earnings and 2020 earnings overall. Here are the highlights.  


Revenue was $278.5 million during full year 2020, an increase of 337%, compared to $63.7 million during full year 2019.  


Net loss was $138.8 million during full year 2020, compared to a net loss of $22.5 million during full year 2019.  


Adjusted EBITDA was $4.4 million during full year 2020, compared to $(7.8) million during full year 2019  


According to Eilers and Krejcik, RSI’s U.S. online casino was the second largest online casino operator as measured by GGR for the full year.  


RSI expects revenues for the full year ending December 31, 2021 to be between $420 and $460 million, up from our previous guidance of $320 million. At the midpoint of the range, revenue of $440 million represents 58% year-over-year expected revenue growth when compared to $278.5 million of revenues for 2020.  


RSI has submitted applications to have its sportsbook and casino apps available for download in the Google Play Store for Android users in connection with Google’s decision to permit use of real money gaming apps in the United States for the first time.

4. **OBV**

# 1. INTRODUCTION

My fellow apes,

First off,  I will be using indicators to help gauge future outlooks. But it is important to remember that although indicators can help show what a situation is like. It is just that, there is no certainty behind any of what will be mentioned here today. Anyways, I will be using 3 indicators (RSI, MACD, OBV) to help form a thesis from a technical standpoint.

# 2. RSI

>*The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions*

**DAILY CHART:**

https://preview.redd.it/5zx3i10y70t61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=df7497de1f97fbb566878c7773d6754bd3e9bd0b

Typically when the RSI falls short of 30, the underlying security can be considered underbought. Although GME currently has an RSI of 42 on the daily chart, it is important to denote that since the start of January GME's RSI has not dipped below 41. Also, remember that this timeframe accounts for the malicious practices played by MM's and Hedge Funds during the great drop from  $500 - $40. Based on this, 42 can be seen as the new 30, valuing GME as underbought/oversold.

**4 HOUR CHART:**

https://preview.redd.it/rb879baz70t61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=d863c3ff44db6080f2ad4bc76b8b53b1b703423f

Moving on to the 4-hour chart, GME's current RSI is 30. Similar to the daily chart the current RSI sets a new low since the previous levels that have been tested across the $10 range. Now, based on past trends the last time GME tested this level an immediate bounce followed. For instance, on March 24 GME had an RSI of 31 which was immediately followed by an increase of around 80% in just a few days. Although past performance is not indicative of future results, GME is situated in a similar position and the RSI has already begun its reversal.

&#x200B;

**SYNOPSIS:**

RSI has blown past the underbought/oversold territory, and this is shown through a plateau on the daily chart and a slight reversal on the 4-hour chart.

# 3. MACD

>*Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. The result of that calculation is the MACD line.*

**DAILY CHART:**

https://preview.redd.it/yqrqk60280t61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=adc0d0ea92a77a204ab789bc2551df670de68189

Most recently GME's MACD diverged on the 19th of March. Leaving us in a downwards trend. To help predict when this trend might end I will be taking the previous dip from $500 down to $40 to account. On the 3rd of February, a divergence occurred placing GME in a downwards trend. And it wasn't until the 25th of February until another divergence occurred, setting GME's trajectory upwards of $350 in the matter of a few days. Although we have quite a ways to hit the original MACD reversal levels found on February 25th, it is important to recall the blatant manipulation which caused retail to originally sell. Leading me to believe that retail is now better equipped to handle such events. Which should speed up the process of another divergence occurring, further placing us in an upwards trend.

**4 HOUR CHART:**

https://preview.redd.it/5qz3dz5380t61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc2f428e18a6d6a18e8b952991300b8c21705ffe

When taking a look at the 4-hour chart we can already see plateauing on the MACD histogram. Although this timeframe is not large enough to accurately predict whether another divergence will occur soon. It does however indicate that there is not enough selling pressure to cause a major price drop anytime soon.

&#x200B;

**SYNOPSIS:**

MACD shows that we are nearing the end of the current downwtrend and I am hopeful that a reversal will take place in the near future.

# 4. OBV

>*On-balance volume (OBV) is a technical trading momentum indicator that uses volume flow to predict changes in stock price.*

I will be comparing the OBV of different stocks to highlight what is currently going on with GME.

I want to keep this short, but if you want to read more [u/jarofmy](https://www.reddit.com/user/jarofmy/) has a more detailed post on this matter.

As we can tell, the OBV figure will typically maintain the same look as the price chart. But this is not the case with GME. Towards the end of January, when the price of GME was fluctuating anywhere from $300 - $500, OBV maintained volume of around 20 million on the 2-hour chart. Current OBV is hovering at around 21 million, a slight increase from previous levels. Indicating that GME's price should be at a similar price point to when OBV was at 20 million. However, GME's price is non-reflective of this and continues to descend. If you were to solely gauge the OBV and predict a price, $300 - $500 is where GME should currently stand.

# TL:DR

Technical Analysis on GME is currently very bullish. And I believe that we are nearing a reversal in due time. RSI and MACD are indicative of this and OBV helps to further illustrate this.

# Posting Guidelines:

The first image should include all the information about your trade, such as:

* Stock name

* Number of shares / contracts

* Total invested amount

* Profit / Loss

* Strike(s) and/or Expiry Date (if applicable)

Other images are optional. People love seeing all time graphs, so include that where possible. 

When your positions exceed a single screenshot, place the largest one first.

**Leave a comment with why you entered the trades that you did.** This is usually more interesting than the gain / loss porn itself. You took the risk and put your money where your mouth is, tell us why.

---

##*Important!* 

* Your gain or loss *must* be realized, or about to expire (<1 day) before you can post. If it's good enough to screenshot, it's good enough to close. (**YOLO threads are exempt from this**)

* Be timely with your posts, if you have a big gain, loss, or YOLO, post it right away. No one wants to see a bet you made months ago.

* The minimum applies to any amount you hold **in a single company**, so three $1K losses on TSLA puts at different strikes/expiries is allowed, but a $1K loss on TSLA, PLTR, and AAPL puts is not. That's called diversification, and diversification is for pussies.

We're not suggesting you close your current positions, but we want to make sure that the threads that are being posted are interesting and meaningful. As they say, it's not a loss until you sell... right?!

Privateer has been building up multiple THC brands in the U.S. and guess what... these same brands Privateer is running in the U.S. are the brands that Tilray is selling in Canada through their High Park subsidiary that has licensing agreements to produce and distribute these brands. Privateer is the parent organization of Docklight Brands, an American cannabis company, which owns 3 of the brands High Park sells in Canada. So once regulations allow, I can only imagine that Tilray would take over docklight and have existing brands in the U.S."
1618345495.0,43,"DD: $CMPS Short-, Mid-, and Long-Term Home-Run"," What I’m looking for is people to tell me why I’m wrong, because I feel \*fucking certain\* that anyone who puts his money into $CMPS will double it by Jan 1 2022, and I have no plans to sell when that happens. This is a WSB play from soup to nuts: betting that a pharma start-up with a single drug will hit big.

**TL;DR:** Buy $CMPS. Not financial advice.

**Background**

Company: Compass Pathways

Ticker: $CMPS

Market Cap (4/13/2021): $1.33b

Current Share Price (4/13/2021): $36.16

ATH Share Price (12/23/20): $59.20

About (in my own words): Mental healthcare drug co. w/ patented, synthetic form of psilocybin (active ingredient in ‘magic mushrooms’) called COMP360. Their drug is currently in Phase IIb FDA Trials, with results expected to report late 2021.

**The Background That Matters**

1. **Leadership and Investors:** $CMPS was an early public mover in the psychedelics space in the US. Pre-IPO they linked up with Christian Angermayer, whose 29% pre-IPO investment now represents 22% of the company’s shares, last I heard. He brought his friend Peter Thiel in on the party. Anyway, Angermayer is the owner of Atai Life Sciences, which I can write about here because they haven’t yet IPO’d. This relationship w/ Atai is important for two reasons: 1) Atai functions as an accelerator/incubator/parent co. for their umbrella of companies who are all seeking to address mental health concerns w/ psychedelics and psychedelic-adjacent drugs, which gives $CMPS access to huge resources (human, IP, and tech), and 2) Atai is going to go public soon, which will bring $$$ to the space. $CMPS cash position and access to capital is super-solid because of all info above.
2. **Patents:** $CMPS developed a synthetic form of psilocybin, COMP360. This drug was given Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA in 2018, which is as good and as rare as it sounds like it should be. Essentially they have the blessing and the support of the FDA, which is really fucking good if you want to bring a drug to market. They now *also* have three patents for COMP360 for the treatment of Treatment-Resistant Depression (depression that has withstood 2+ attempts at treatment by conventional drugs) and Major Depressive Disorder aka MDD, which is much larger and more pernicious… meaning that if their trials are successful, they have \~10 years of exclusive right to treat these conditions with their drugs.

**3)** **Psychedelics work:** There is enough study and anecdotal evidence to support the efficacy of psilocybin as a treatment for TRD and MDD. A WSB compilation of evidence can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/li9jtm/shroom_stocks_are_they_really_the_next_big_thing/). If you don’t believe that psilocybin works as a treatment, the DoD, your friends, and most well-read psychologists will disagree. But do your own research. It’s a lynchpin of this play.

**The Bear Argument(s)**

This is what I love most about this play: If you take the long position on $CMPS, you are betting against boomers (ironically, you’re doing it by betting *on* boomers (mushrooms (psilocybin))).

**1)** **Magic Mushrooms are Illegal!** Yeah, no shit, buddy. But this play depends essentially not at all upon the legality of psilocybin or its synthetic alternatives. $CMPS is working to get drug approval through the FDA, not the DEA. If you want to tell me that the DEA in 2023 is going to kick in the doors of pharmacies and doctors’ offices to seize synthetic psilocybin that was approved by the FDA for use in the treatment of mental health disorders – well, great. I can and will take that bet.

**2)** **The FDA May Not Approve.** True. But color me skeptical. The FDA has a history of approving some fairly novel drugs if they are shown to be effective, including J&J’s ketamine nasal spray for the treatment of treatment-resistant depression in 2019. If the FDA were going to take a Puritanistic stance on psychedelics, they would’ve done it before offering Breakthrough Therapy Designation to COMP360.

**3)** **Psychiatric drugs only make it to market 16% of the time.** 

[Here’s](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4395315-compass-pathways-risky-and-overvalued) a dated, thorough, completely-wrong valuation of $CMPS posted to SA a few months back. The author uses an industry-average 16% approval rate (the average success / make-it-to-market rate for psychiatric drugs in Phase IIb drug trials) to value $CMPS. [This dude](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4414599-compass-pathways-comp360-probabilities-of-success-are-underestimated-in-rnpv-models) correctly eviscerates the shmuck’s argument by pointing out that psilocybin has a massive, jaw-dropping dataset behind it, making its likelihood of success much, much higher than 16%... he just fucks up by suggesting $CMPS as only 4% of your portfolio.

**4)** **Their trial dose of 25mg will be incorrect.** Doubtful. All signs point to this being the optimal dose, as indicated by the NEJM study with results released tomorrow 4/14 (doses at 20mg and 30mg over six weeks) + older studies at Hopkins. Will it be perfect? No. But it’ll probably work for nearly everyone.

**5)** **Interest rates increase and cash burn happens and single-drug pipeline and etc. and it just won’t work.** Psych companies are going public, and they’re doing so with support from huge players. If interest rates go up, if inflation sets in – sure, the cash on-hand becomes less valuable. So they get more cash. Smart health sciences investors know this sector is the move. They are making the money available. $CMPS has years of runway on-hand.

**6)** **$CMPS is unethical.** $CMPS has come under fire recently for acting like pharma assholes. They’re trying to file patents for everything from soft chairs to paint colors. That’s why they’re unpopular over on subs dedicated to investing in psychedelic stocks, and why they’re taking heat in the still-small psychedelic circles. But to be honest, I could give a fuck. Their drug is going to work, and it’s going to go to market, and it’s going to help people, and if they have protections around it, well, all the better for my investment.

**7)** **Mushrooms aren’t medicine they’re drugs you fuckin’ kids!** Fuck you, dude. Read the data.

**The Bull Argument**

Psilocybin works. Existing depression drugs do not. The mental health crisis is just that – a [crisis](https://www.mhanational.org/issues/state-mental-health-america) – and it is growing at a scary rate, bolstered largely by depressed kids under age 18. We have two generations of combat veterans grappling with PTSD and a DoD that is supportive of alternative treatments. When these companies catch the public eye, money will flood into this space, and it will go largely to the biggest fish in the pond.

**Catalysts**

1. Upcoming IPO of Atai
2. Upcoming NASDAQ uplist of comparable psych stock <$1b market cap
3. End 2021 Phase IIb read-out
4. **4/14/21** NEJM releases first head-to-head study comparing SSRI (escitalopram) anti-depressant drug vs. psilocybin (2 Tx over 6 wks) in treating TRD. We'll probably see a pop this week, as the findings sound very predictably promising.

**Short-Term Play**

May/June calls. Hell, maybe even 4/16 fliers if you get in before the NEJM study drop. When Atai IPO’s and another sub-$1b player uplists to the NASDAQ, money will flow into psychedelics, and $CMPS will catch a windfall. They’re on sale right now and are in a better position than when they traded at their ATH in Dec 2020.

**Mid-Term Play**

Jan/Feb 2022 calls + shares. $CMPS will give a read-out of their Phase IIb trials in late 2021. When the reports are positive and they move into Phase III, the fireworks will start.

**Long-Term Play**

Shares. COMP360 will go to market and take a sizeable portion of same. It’s an effective drug with \~10-years’ patent protection in an increasingly alternative-medicine driven society facing a mental health cataclysm.

1618343710.0,6,Twist Bioscience (TWST) - great biotech play and also working with Microsoft on the future of data storage. Let me know what you think!,"Here's a short DD on why I think TWST is the best pick going for both short and long term returns:

&#x200B;

1. Genomics stocks are volatile, but with potential for huge returns. One way of getting exposure is by buying companies developing the actual medicines (think CRSP, EDIT, NTLA). These are a bit of a lottery tho as you don't really know if they will pass clinical trials. TWST on the other hand, manufactures DNA to be used in the types of aforementioned companies' research. Therefore, by owning TWST you can get exposure to the industry without being exposed to one company or another having a successful or not clinical trial for a certain medicine.
2. 64% revenue growth over the first quarter of 2020 was reported earlier this year, but the stock go caught up in the massive sell off for all high risk tech stocks. The stock peaked at over $200 earlier this year, and now being at \~140 provides a chance for some great short term upside. As we are seeing in today's market, when confidence comes back to the market the big caps are first to benefit, followed by the small/mid caps. TWST is perfectly positioned for this next small/mid cap move.
3. Longer term, the stock is even more exciting. They are working with Microsoft (and Illumina (ILMN)) as the founding members of a working group to define the future of data storage using DNA. Give it 10 years, and we will be seeing this method used for data storage. And long before then, once the first signs of progress are seen the hype will be too much for stocks to handle. That last part could happen far before anyone can predict...

There are loads of other reasons this company provides the lowest risk high risk investment you will ever find, but I won't bore you. Do some of your own DD and remember this isn't financial advice. Really, I know nothing.

&#x200B;

They also have a great website with some great colour schemes."

1618343677.0,2,"An extremely bullish DD on $APD, a stock that's passed under the clean energy radar","I've been looking into Hydrogen for quite a while, especially more recently with the hit its taken, but the more I've looked into it, the more I think APD is severely undervalued at its current price. I'd love to hear other opinions on this, and Hydrogen in general, but I also want to give my perspective, and why I'm extremely bullish on it.

I think hydrogen has a better future than EV. Hydrogen production costs have fallen 40% since 2015,and are expected to fall by a further 40% through 2025. It's always been the fuel of the future, the issue is with making it safe to store. $2/kg is a potential tipping point that will make hydrogen competitive in multiple sectors, including power generation and long-range shipping. 

People think we need to move to EV cars to lower Carbon Dioxide emissions is the big move we need to make, but transport only accounts for 16% of greenhouse gases. Planes cannot run off electricity or solar, they would require either nuclear power, or hydrogen to sustain travel. Maybe you might disagree here, but I think the safety concerns would make it unfeasible. For a lot of industries, especially ones reliant on forms crude oil, hydrogen may be the only feasible replacement, with its extremely high kilogram calorific value. Other viable options are Butane, Methane, and Natural Gas. 

Suppose hydrogen never took off as a fuel supply for transport. What are other uses of hydrogen? Well, key factors driving the hydrogen generation market growth include rising demand for petroleum coke in the steel industry and development in the cement and power generation industries, this all ignoring the many favourable government initiatives regarding the sustainable and green environment.

$APD not only produces hydrogen, but also have room to grow in their production of Oxygen, Nitrogen, Argon and Carbon Dioxide. They have great earnings and a P/E ratio below 40. The projected market for Oxygen is $30 Billion by 2025, for Nitrogen its about $33 Billion. Argon has a much smaller, but not insignificant projected market of $487 million by 2026, and $12.1 billion for carbon dioxide by 2027. As if that weren't enough, they also produce semiconductor materials (with a semiconductor shortage, there is a lot to gain here); natural gas liquefaction technology and equipment (I don't know much about that stuff); epoxy additives (Epoxy resins are used in Wind Turbines, Electrical systems like circuit boards. Epoxy resin market is expected to almost double in value to over $10 Billion); Gas Cabinets (It costs $4k to get a projected market size, I aint paying that shit, but for reference here's what wikipedia has to say: A gas cabinet is a metallic enclosure which is used to provide local exhaust ventilation system for virtually all of the gases used or generated in the Semiconductor, Solar, MEMS, NANO, Solar PV, Manufacturing and other advanced technologies.).

In case you're not convinced yet, lets take a look at their competitors. LINDE PLC is the the leader by market cap, with revenues of $27.24 billion annually. APD have a YOY revenue of $8.86 Billion. However, take a look at net income. Despite only making $8.86 Billion, they have a net income of $1.9 billion (a profit margin of 21.5%),while Linde have a net income of $2.5 billion (profit margin of 9%). What makes APD even better is that they have been steadily increasing their YOY profit margin. Linde rocks a P/E ratio of about 60. I think it isn't crazy to put a similar price target on APD, which would essentially double their share price. Even on a bearish case, I think it wouldn't be unreasonable to put such a prediction for this pricetag over the next 2-3 years. 

TLDR: I think this is severly undervalued. They are profitable now, but do they have room to fucking grow. As clean energy is pushed more and more, I think their earnings will grow exponentially, and I wouldn't put it past them to do it."

1618343380.0,1277,$RIDE with Lordstown – Huge catalyst this weekend and a chart ready for a break-out 🚀 🚀 🚀,"**$RIDE – Brief Overview**

Lordstown Motors Corp ($RIDE) was founded in 2019 and began developing their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). They got a jump start, relative to other competitors, due to GM’s investment in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/). 

$RIDE assembled an [experienced management team](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management) with multiple executives & VPs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, Honda, Workhorse, etc. What these executives realized is that the general public isn’t ready for the mass-adoption of electric vehicles right now. So, the way to hit the ground running in this industry, is to sell their electric trucks to commercial fleets. 

Commercial fleets are literally the perfect fit for electrification. This is because, when a construction worker gets back from a long day at the job site, he can just plug his truck in to charge overnight before heading back to work the next day. Additionally, electric trucks come with a 25-30% lower total cost of ownership. This is largely because of lower maintenance costs for EVs and, in $RIDE’s case, their truck gets 75mpg equivalent (which is over 3x the mpg that a pick-up usually gets). 

Fleet managers care about efficiency and cost – so $RIDE makes their truck a no brainer for fleets. Once their trucks are on the open market **this September**, every fleet manager and their brother will be buying these. 🚀 🚀 🚀

$RIDE is showing their level of confidence in their truck **this Saturday** by participating in [one of the most brutal proving grounds imaginable for a truck](https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/enthusiasts/lordstown-endurance-ev-pickups-baja-debut-is-serious-business/ar-BB1dWYrd) – the SCORE San Felipe 250 off-road race. The event will take place at Mexico's Baja California Peninsula, and it will be publicly televised. This is called a Proof of Concept (POC), and it will showcase why $RIDE’s truck is a fleet manager’s dream. *No other EV companies out there have the fucking balls to sign their trucks up for something like this.* [$RIDE has been preparing for the race](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1381955618278363138?s=20), and this will show they have a functioning truck. 

**20 reasons to invest in $RIDE**

&#x200B;

1. [The government is proposing massive infrastructure spend](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a36017463/biden-23-trillion-infrastructure-plan-electric-cars/). This is a game-changer for EV stocks like $RIDE. It’s also huge for the construction industry, which consists of thousands of fleets that utilize full-size pick-up trucks.

&#x200B;

2. Bringing the first full-size electric pick-up to market, *The* *Endurance*, **this September**. The bestselling 3 vehicles in the US are pick-up trucks – many of which operate in fleet sector. $RIDE is laser-focused on the light duty vehicle market – which will represent nearly a [$1 trillion market opportunity by 2025](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-light-duty-vehicles-market).

&#x200B;

3. [Backed by GM](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) who sold them a [6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html) over 2 years ago now for pennies on the dollar. 3rd most productive automotive plant in the country.

&#x200B;

4. Utilizes [revolutionary all-electric In-Wheel Drive System](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/tech) with four hub motors & integrated software. [This will change the automotive industry for decades to come](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1331299805147123713?s=20). Aside from $RIDE, [Lexus is considering using this technology](https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1124036_lexus-will-pursue-in-wheel-electric-motors-for-future-cars) as well.

&#x200B;

5. [Partnered with Camping World](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/16/2146315/0/en/Camping-World-and-Lordstown-Motors-Partner-to-Establish-Nationwide-EV-Service-Network-Announce-Plans-to-Develop-Electric-Solutions-for-the-RV-Industry.html).This partnership will allow $RIDE to leverage over 170 Service and Collision Centers across the US (instant ability to scale across country). This will give fleets the peace of mind knowing there are locations all over the country to get their vehicles fixed if there are issues.

&#x200B;

6. They will be able to create multiple vehicles with the same core components because of the simplicity of their state-of-the-art [skateboard chassis](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1130616_lordstown-thrashes-the-skateboard-for-its-endurance-electric-truck-in-wheel-motors-and-all). This creates insanely high production efficiency. They’re already planning to release design for their next vehicle: a van, this summer.

&#x200B;

7. Marcus Lemonis, CEO of Camping World, [tweeted a leak two weeks ago of the $RIDE RV](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) that is being worked on in conjunction with Camping World. The electric RV market is going to be huge.

&#x200B;

8. [Already have more than 500 employees](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/ohio/articles/2021-02-17/startup-electric-truck-maker-wants-ohio-to-ok-direct-sales) and will be up to 1500 employees by production this September.

&#x200B;

9. Announced an [agreement with Holman Enterprises](https://www.holmanenterprises.com/news/holman-enterprises-lordstown-motors-announce-co-marketing-agreement-and-expanded-alliance/) – a fleet provider that manages \~ 2 million vehicles. An analyst commented that [this agreement alone would generate over 12,000 orders](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/can-lordstown-motors-overcome-the-credibility-hurdle-analyst-weighs-in-2021-03-18).

&#x200B;

10. Signed a [multi-year supplier agreement with LG Energy Solution](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/02/03/lordstown-motors-electric-pickup-will-use-tesla-batteries-from-lg/#:~:text=Lordstown%20Motors%20Electric%20Pickup%20Will%20Use%20%E2%80%9CTesla%20Batteries%E2%80%9D%20From%20LG&text=Lordstown%20Motors'%20CEO%20Steve%20Burns,Model%203%20and%20Model%20Y.), a global leader in battery cell technology, to broaden their high-quality, diverse battery cell supply chain. These are “Tesla batteries.” 

&#x200B;

11. [GM and LG are building a battery plant right across the street from $RIDE’s facility](https://businessjournaldaily.com/gm-lg-chem-select-lordstown-site-for-plant/). Think about the efficiency of being next-door neighbors with your battery supplier.

&#x200B;

12. If celebrity endorsements are your thing, [Joe Burrow](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/work-for-it-joe-burrow) and [Guy Fieri](https://www.foxnews.com/auto/flavortown-mayor-guy-fieri-lordstown-motors-twitter) like to $RIDE.

&#x200B;

13. At max capacity, the $RIDE [facility will be able to produce up to 600,000 vehicles each year](https://www.carscoops.com/2020/05/lordstown-motors-ceo-thinks-ev-startup-can-build-600000-vehicles-a-year/).

&#x200B;

14. An [article from February](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/shutdown-in-lordstown/lordstown-motors-seeks-state-waiver-to-sell-future-vehicles-directly-to-consumers-in-ohio) that I dug up quoted the $RIDE Director of Government Relations & Corporate Affairs, Chris Kerzich. There was a quote from Chris that said: “Right now it's going to take us a couple of years to fulfill that demand. And that demand does not even include Federal and state vehicles, which those have to go through a procurement process, so we are primarily focused right now on meeting the commercial demand that we have."" 

&#x200B;

15. Have been testing their skateboard chassis in both [desert conditions](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1369663762698014724?s=20) and [snowy conditions](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1357335736324866048?s=20).

&#x200B;

16. Have [over $600m cash on hand](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020), which is more than enough to get to full production this September.

&#x200B;

17. Have hit [fully-automated beta production](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1377350607518920705?s=20), meaning [robots are welding their vehicles](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1372178838063570944?s=20).This means they are very close to fully-automated mass-production.

&#x200B;

18. Yesterday, a video was shown of [vehicles being sent out for additional crash testing](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1381683369826746371?s=20). 

&#x200B;

19. In the final due diligence stage for the[ Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lordstown-motors-corp-advances-next-123000404.html). Receiving this loan would be a huge catalyst for the stock, and an announcement is expected **any day now**. It says a lot that they are in this stage as it means the DOE has been taking a deep dive into their financials, operations, and personnel. If they are awarded the loan, this is yet another catalyst that will send this stock soaring. 

&#x200B;

20. The 6-month chart shows $RIDE has made this same violent move downward multiple times, and each time, made a violent move upwards shortly after. I will now explain why this time of FUD is a buying opportunity.

&#x200B;

**$RIDE – A time of FUD creates a massive buying opportunity**

Okay, so what kind of DD would this be if I didn’t explain to you why the stock has plunged close to 70% from all-time-highs? I want to walk you through the 2 main things that brought the stock down and show you why this time of FUD is a buying opportunity.

1. Short-seller, Hindenburg Research, targeted $RIDE in a research report last month. Piece of advice – never believe a short-seller until you do your own DD. They obviously want retail investors to panic and sell the stock so they can make money on their short position. After all, Hindenburg is literally just a [5-man shop](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-nikola-stock-got-torched-by-a-short-seller-11600867055) ran out of an [apartment in New York](https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_ny/5471661). I think their ego got too big after they successfully shorted Nikola. Feel free to check out [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) because it refuted all of Hindenburg’s main accusations against $RIDE.

You know a short-seller is full of BS when the state of Ohio comes to the defense of the attacked company. At the bottom of [this article](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), Senator Michael Rulli discusses how far along $RIDE is and says “anyone who was in that plant would read that short-report and think it was garbage.” Additionally, U.S. Rep Tim Ryan called the short-report a “bull-\*\*\*\* hatchet job for the short-seller to make money.”

Secretary of State [Frank LaRose](https://businessjournaldaily.com/larose-visits-lordstown-motors/) also visited $RIDE’s facility to confirm how legit this operation is. Plus, Ohio Governor [Dewine’s Grandson works at Lordstown as a Government Affairs Lobbyist](https://www.cleveland.com/open/2021/02/gov-mike-dewines-grandson-hired-as-lobbyist-for-electric-vehicle-manufacturer-lordstown-motors.html).

This shows that the state of Ohio is backing $RIDE. It helps to have friends in the right places during times like this. 

2. Lawsuits and SEC Inquiry. Basically, there are a couple of lawsuits and an SEC probe that are looking into $RIDE’s pre-orders. $RIDE claimed to have 100,000 non-binding reservations, and there are now questions about whether or not these pre-orders are legit. This does not concern me. Like I mentioned earlier $RIDE Director of Government Relations & Corporate Affairs, Chris Kerzich, already made it clear that demand is robust, and it will take them “a couple of years” to fulfill the current demand. 

All of this has been blown out of proportion based on my research. [Here’s a link of some current SEC probes](https://probesreporter.com/). There are a lot of companies you know very well that are being looked at by the SEC constantly. The reality is, there are 1000’s of SEC inquiries each year into publicly traded companies. The end result is almost always a slap on the wrist. Let’s take Tesla for example. Do you remember a couple of years ago when Elon tweeted he was going to take $TSLA private at $420 a share, which was a premium to the share price at the time? That was literally stock market manipulation by Elon, and it was probably one of the most illegal things a public company could do. There were dozens of lawsuits and a full-blown SEC investigation. Well, [the end result was literally just a $20 million fine for Elon and a $20 million fine for $TSLA](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-226). Basically, slap on the wrist. And that was 100x more serious than $RIDE’s non-binding pre-orders. 

The point I’m making is this: Don’t be fooled by the media. They make lawsuits and SEC involvement seem way worse than they actually are. Do your homework and invest in companies with high-growth potential when times of FUD create buying opportunities.

Look at institutional investment too. [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/ride/ownership) and [Fintel](https://fintel.io/so/us/ride) show that institutions have consistently been adding $RIDE to their holdings the past couple of months.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

$RIDE is an EV growth company currently trading at a large discount (50% of their asset value). They have a $3B facility and over $600m cash on hand, but only a $1.8B market cap after the recent sell-off. Please view [this investor presentation](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/static-files/ef77bce6-b19a-4288-a651-e08089f1362f) for any additional questions on the company. [$RIDE is massively oversold](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/lordstown-motors-becomes-oversold-ride-2021-04-05) right now.

***$RIDE*** [***short % of float is now over 21% as of today***](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=ride&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2)***, which is exactly the fuel we need for a massive move upwards.*** 🚀 🚀 🚀

Remember: Bulls make money, bears make money, but pigs get slaughtered. To me, it is apparent that shorts have gotten greedy on $RIDE.

&#x200B;

**Position:**

3868 shares @ $12.22. I believe this stock will be back to its 52 week high of $32.00 by the end of this summer, and it will be $40 by production in September. $RIDE currently has one of the lowest market caps ($1.8B) out of all of the EV plays, yet they are the closest to mass production. Lots of upside here.

&#x200B;

**TL:DR**

$RIDE stock currently presents a great entry point. People who are doubting American EV stocks are probably the same people who didn’t believe the internet was the next big thing back in the 90’s. It’s very clear that EVs are the future, and $RIDE has a huge opportunity ahead. 🚀 🚀 🚀"

1618341344.0,0,$SDC (SmileDirectClub)," 

This is my first attempt at DD, but it should be a  doozy.

SmileDirect  is a company that delivers teeth mold kits to peoples houses so they  can mold their own teeth and send back the kit and have a liner sent to  their house (this can also be done at the orthodontist). Its a pretty  ingenious way to get people the smiles that they want at 2/3 the price  of its competetor Invisalign, (ALGN) which im sure most have heard of.  now when you compare the two, both have close to 100 million shares  outstanding, BESIDES that ALGN has a market cap of nearly 50 billion,  while SDC close to 4 billion (undervalued af). now, a major difference  between the two, is that SDC is being shorted %30!! Its had very little  volume, but they thing is, when volume does pick up it moves very  quickly. The potential for a short squeeze is there. Check it out!
